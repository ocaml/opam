[WARNING] Flag --formula is experimental, there is no guarantee that it will be kept; avoid using it in scripts.
Everything as up-to-date as possible (run with --verbose to show unavailable upgrades).

The following packages are not being upgraded because the new versions conflict with other installed packages:
  - ocaml.4.10.0
    -- ocaml-freestanding.0.4.5 is installed and requires ocaml (>= 4.05.0 & < 4.09.0)
    -- ocaml-src.4.08.0 is installed and requires ocaml = 4.08.0
However, you may "opam upgrade" these packages explicitly, which will ask permission to downgrade or uninstall the conflicting packages.
Nothing to do.
