STATE                           Definition missing for installed package i-am-compiler.1, copying from repo
STATE                           Inferred invariant: from base packages { i-am-compiler.1 }, (roots { i-am-compiler.1 }) => ["i-am-compiler" {= "1"}]

Everything as up-to-date as possible (run with --verbose to show unavailable upgrades).
However, you may "opam upgrade" these packages explicitly, which will ask permission to downgrade or uninstall the conflicting packages.
Nothing to do.
