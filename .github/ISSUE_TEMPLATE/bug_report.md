Welcome to the opam issue tracker!

The best way to help us dig on the issue is to provide informations on how the
error occurred, outputs, opam version, and ideally a reproducible case (we know
that it is not always the case).

Before opening an issue, please check if there is one already existing, even
in closed ones: https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues?q=is%3Aissue+

If your issue concerns a package not building, please report to
https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues or to the package bugtracker
unless you are confident it is an issue in the opam tool itself.
