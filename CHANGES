  output selection
* Delay the removals of packages as much as possible, avoiding most cases of
  mass uninstalled packages after a build failure

  build and install*, or unrelated files could get removed on package uninstall.

  defined in `~/.opam/config`; include sample Linux wrappers to restrict process
  permissions (e.g. ensure `build:` doesn't install)

  `compiler` flag set
