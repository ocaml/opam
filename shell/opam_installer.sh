Usage:
    ./opam_install BINDIR [COMP]

    Download and installs the latest binary version of opam

    BINDIR is the directory where it should be installed, e.g. /usr/local/bin
    (it should be in your PATH).

    COMP is an optional argument, specifying the initial version of OCaml you
    want to use ($default_ocaml by default. You may use 'system' if you want to
    use an ocaml compiler already present on your system).
