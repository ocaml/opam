# How to install opam

This page describes how to install and configure opam. For further help on how
to use opam, either read [`opam --help`](man/opam.html) or move on to the
[Usage](Usage.html) guide.


## Upgrading from a previous version

Generally, you should just reproduce the same installation steps as for the
original installation: upgrade from your system's package manager, or re-run the
binary installer. Opam will automatically update its internal repository at
`~/.opam` on first run if needed (if using our installer script, a backup can be
made automatically).

To upgrade shell scripts, and enable sandboxing, don't forget to run `opam init
--reinit -ni`.

Then see the [Upgrade guide](Upgrade_guide.html) to check the changes.


## Binary distribution

The quickest way to get the latest opam up and working is to run
[this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh):
```
sh <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh)
```

This will simply check your architecture, download and install the proper
pre-compiled binary, backup your opam data if from an older version, and run
`opam init`.

(If you have trouble with `curl`, just
[download the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh)
and run `sh install.sh`)

We provide pre-compiled binaries for:
- Linux i686, amd64, arm7, arm64
- OSX (intel 64 bits)
(other platforms are available using the other methods below)

If you don't like scripts, you can just pick your download
[here](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases), put it in your PATH as
`opam`, and set it as executable, e.g.

```
sudo cp <downloaded file> /usr/local/bin/opam
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/opam
```

> Note that this script is intended for end-users, not CI. For that purpose,
> you can use pre-built [Docker images for various
> configurations](https://hub.docker.com/r/ocaml/opam2/).

## Using your distribution's package system

This is generally the recommended way, **when available and up-to-date** (you
can check [here](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/wiki/Distributions) the latest
available release per distribution). Here is a list of supported distributions:

#### Archlinux

The [opam](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/opam/)
package is available in the official distribution. To install it simply run:

```
pacman -S opam
```

If you'd like to use the development version there is an [opam-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/opam-git/)
package available in the [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR).
Assuming you have [yaourt](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yaourt) installed just run the following command:

```
yaourt -S opam-git
```

#### Debian

Binary packages of opam are available for the
[stable](http://packages.debian.org/jessie/opam),
[testing](http://packages.debian.org/stretch/opam) and
[unstable](http://packages.debian.org/sid/opam) distributions, from the official
repositories. You should be set with:

```
apt-get install opam
```

#### [Exherbo](http://exherbo.org)

The
[`dev-ocaml/opam`](http://git.exherbo.org/summer/packages/dev-ocaml/opam/index.html)
package can be installed with the command:

```
cave resolve -x dev-ocaml/opam
```

You might need to add the `::ocaml-unofficial` repository first:

```
cave resolve -x repository/ocaml-unofficial
```

#### [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org), [CentOS](http://centos.org) and RHEL

The opam package for Fedora can be installed with the command:

```
dnf install opam
```

There is not currently a package for CentOS/RHEL. You will need to use our
pre-built binaries, or build from sources.

#### Mageia

The opam package for Mageia can be installed with the command:

```
urpmi opam
```

#### OpenBSD

Opam builds via sources fine on OpenBSD 5.6 or earlier, and is available in the
ports and packages tree on OpenBSD 5.7 or higher.

```
cd /usr/ports/sysutils/opam
make install
```

#### FreeBSD

Opam is available in the ports and packages tree on FreeBSD 11 or higher.

```
cd /usr/ports/devel/ocaml-opam
make install
```

#### OSX

Opam packages for [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) and [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) are available.
homebrew need a prior installation of `gpatch`, as opam uses gnu-specific options.

```
# Homebrew
brew install gpatch
brew install opam

# MacPort
port install opam
```

#### Ubuntu

##### Versions 18.04 and newer
There is a [ppa](https://launchpad.net/~avsm/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) available that contains the current stable version of `opam`.
```
add-apt-repository ppa:avsm/ppa
apt update
apt install opam
```

##### Versions older than 18.04
Use the binary distribution. Instructions provided at https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html#Binary-distribution

Follow the instructions in the included
[`README.md`](https://github.com/ocaml/opam#readme) to get opam built and
installed from there.
