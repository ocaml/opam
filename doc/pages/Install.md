# How to install opam

This page describes how to install and configure opam. For further help on how
to use opam, either read [`opam --help`](man/opam.html) or move on to the
[Usage](Usage.html) guide.

## Upgrading from a previous version

Generally, you should just reproduce the same installation steps as for the
original installation: upgrade from your system's package manager, or re-run the
binary installer. Opam will automatically update its internal repository at
`~/.opam` on first run if needed (if using our installer script, a backup can be
made automatically).

To upgrade shell scripts, and enable sandboxing, don't forget to run `opam init
--reinit -ni`.

Then see the [Upgrade guide](Upgrade_guide.html) to check the changes.


## Binary distribution

The quickest way to get the latest opam up and working is to run
[this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh):
```
bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://opam.ocaml.org/install.sh)"
```
or [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.ps1) on Windows using PowerShell:
```
Invoke-Expression "& { $(Invoke-RestMethod https://opam.ocaml.org/install.ps1) }"
```

This will simply check your architecture, download and install the proper
pre-compiled binary, backup your opam data if from an older version, and run
`opam init`.

(If you have trouble with `curl`, just
[download the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh)
and run `sh install.sh`)

We provide pre-compiled binaries for:
- Linux (amd64, arm64, ppc64le, s390x, riscv64, armhf, i686)
- macOS (amd64, arm64)
- FreeBSD (amd64)
- OpenBSD (amd64)
- Windows (amd64)
(other platforms are available using the other methods below)

If you don't like scripts, you can just pick your download
[here](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases), put it in your PATH as
`opam`, and set it as executable, e.g.

```
sudo install <downloaded file> /usr/local/bin/opam
```

> Note that this script is intended for end-users, not CI. For that purpose,
> you can use pre-built [Docker images for various
> configurations](https://hub.docker.com/r/ocaml/opam).

## Using your system's package manager

This is generally the recommended way, **when available and up-to-date** (you
can check [here](Distribution.html) the latest
available release per distribution). Here is a list of supported distributions:

#### Arch Linux

[![badge](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/arch/opam.svg)](https://repology.org/project/opam/versions)

The [opam](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/opam/)
package is available in the official distribution. To install it simply run:

```
pacman -S opam
```

If you'd like to use the development version there is an [opam-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/opam-git/)
package available in the [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository).
Assuming you have [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) installed just run the following command:

```
yay -S opam-git
```

#### Debian
