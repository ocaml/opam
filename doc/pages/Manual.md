# The opam Manual

This manual gathers reference information on opam and its file formats. It is
primarily of use for packagers, package maintainers, and repository maintainers.

* For simple usage of opam, see the [Usage](Usage.html) page and the
  comprehensive built-in documentation [`opam [command] --help`](man/index.html).
* For a gentler introduction to packaging, see the
  [Packaging Guide](Packaging.html)
* If you want to hack on opam or build related tools, the API documentation can
  be browsed [here](api/index.html)

## File Hierarchies

### opam root

Opam holds its configuration, metadata, logs, temporary directories, and caches
within a directory that we will call _opam root_. By default, this is `~/.opam`,
and we may refer to it by this name in this manual for the sake of simplicity,
but this can be changed using the `OPAMROOT` environment variable or the
`--root` command-line argument.

An existing opam root is required for opam to operate normally, and one is
created upon running `opam init`. The initial configuration can be defined
through a configuration file at `~/.opamrc`, `/etc/opamrc` or at a location
specified through the `--config` command-line option. If none is present, opam
defaults to its built-in configuration that binds to the OCaml repository at
`https://opam.ocaml.org`.

Except in explicit cases, opam only alters files within its opam root. It is
organised as follows:
- [`~/.opam/config`](#config): the global opam configuration file
- `~/.opam/repo/`: contains the mirrors of the configured package repositories
- [`~/.opam/repo/repos-config`](#repos-config): lists the configured package repositories and their URLs
- `~/.opam/repo/<repo>`: mirror of the given repository
- `~/.opam/opam-init/`: contains opam configuration scripts for the outside world, e.g., shell environment initialisation
- `~/.opam/download-cache/`: caches of downloaded files
- `~/.opam/plugins/<plugin>`: reserved for plugins
- `~/.opam/<switch>`: prefixes of named [switches](#Switches)

### Repositories

Repositories are collection of opam package definitions. They respect the
following hierarchy:
- [`/repo`](#repo): repository configuration file
- [`/packages/<pkgname>/<pkgname>.<version>/opam`](#opam): holds the metadata
  for the given package. `url` and `descr` may also be present, in which case
  they override what may already be present in the `opam` file
- [`/packages/<pkgname>/<pkgname>.<version>/files/`](#files): contains files
  that are copied over the root of the source tree of the given package before
  it gets used.
- `/cache/`: cached package files, by checksum. Note that the cache location is
  configured in the [repo](#repofield-archive-mirrors) file. This name is only
  where `opam admin cache` puts it by default.
- `/archives/`: this is no longer used by opam automatically, but it is the
  canonical place where you should place your package archives if you want to
  serve them from the repository server directly. The URLs of the packages will
  have to be set accordingly.
- `/index.tar.gz`: archive containing the whole repository contents (except the
  cache) needed when serving over HTTP. It can be generated using `opam admin
  index`.

Opam repositories can be accessed using local or
remote (ssh) paths, HTTP URLs, or one of the supported version control systems
(Git, Mercurial, Darcs). A repository is set up using

```
opam repository add <name> <URL> [--this-switch|--all-switches|--set-default]
```

The last flag sets what switches are affected by the new repository:
- `--this-switch` (**default**) selects only the current switch
- `--all-switches` affects all the currently existing switches
- `--set-default` affects all switches created in the future

Creating a new switch using, e.g., a custom repository overlay on the default
repository, can be done in a single call using:
```
opam switch create --repos=<name>=<URL>,default
```
which will define the new repository `<name>` at `<URL>` if needed.

Use `opam repository list --all` for an overview of
configured repositories. Repository selection is always ordered, with the
definition of a given version of a package being taken from the repository with
the lowest index where it is found.

Data from the configured repositories is updated from the upstreams manually
using the `opam update` command. This only updates repositories in use by the
currently selected switches, unless `--all` is specified.

### Switches
Opam is designed to hold any number of concurrent installation prefixes, called
_switches_. Switches are isolated from each other and have their own set of
installed packages, selection of repositories, and configuration options. All
package-related commands operate on a single switch and require one to be
selected.

The current switch can be selected in the following ways:
- Globally, using `opam switch <switch>`. Opam will use that switch for all
  further commands, except when overridden in one of the following ways.
- For local switches, which are external to the opam root, when in the directory
  where the switch resides or a descendant
- By setting the `OPAMSWITCH=<switch>` environment variable, to set it within a
  single shell session. This can be done by running `eval $(opam env --switch
  <switch>)` to set the shell environment at once (see below).
- Through the `--switch <switch>` command-line flag, for a single command

Switches have their own prefix, normally `~/.opam/<switch>`, where packages get
installed. To use what is installed in a switch, some environment variables need
to be set, _e.g,._ to make executables that are installed into `~/.opam/<switch>/bin`
visible, that directory needs to be added to `PATH`, but individual packages can
define their own settings as well.

Command `opam env` returns the environment updates corresponding to the
current switch, in a format readable by your shell, and when needed, opam will
prompt you to run:

```
eval $(opam env)
```

A switch is created using `opam switch create <switch> (<compiler>|--empty)`.
- `<switch>` can be either a plain name or a directory name (if containing `/`
  or starting with `.`). In the latter case, the switch is _local_, and instead of
  being held at `~/.opam/<switch>`, it will be created in the given directory
  as a `_opam` subdirectory. Local switches are automatically selected depending
  on the current directory (see above).
- If a `<compiler>` is selected, opam will install the corresponding packages
  and their dependencies in the new switch. These packages will be marked as
  _base_, protected against removal, and unaffected by upgrade commands.
  `<compiler>` can be selected among packages which have the `compiler` flag
  set, or their versions. Use `opam switch list-available` to list them.

#### Structure

If we define `<switch-prefix>` as:
- `~/.opam/<switch>` for plain switches
- `<switch>/_opam` for local switches, when `<switch>` is a path

Switches are laid out thusly:
- `<switch-prefix>/`: prefix of the switch, which holds the installation hierarchy
  in the UNIX `/usr` standard (with subdirectories `bin`, `lib`, `share`, `man`,
  `doc`, `etc`)
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/`: holds all opam data regarding this switch
- [`<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/switch-config`: switch-specific
  configuration](#switch-config)
- [`<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/switch-state`: stores the sets
  of installed, base, and pinned packages](#switch-state)
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/environment`: contains the environment variable
  settings for this switch
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/reinstall`: list of packages marked for
  reinstallation (development packages where changes have been detected)
- [`<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/config/<pkgname>.config`](#lt-pkgname-gt-config):
  installed packages, opam specific configuration
- [`<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/install/<pkgname>.install`](#lt-pkgname-gt-install):
  `.install` files used to install the given package
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/install/<pkgname>.changes`: file system changes
  done by the installation of the given package, as tracked by <span class="opam">opam</span>
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/packages/<pkgname>.<version>/`: metadata of the
  given package as it has been used for its installation
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/sources/<pkgname>.<version>/` or `<pkgname>/`:
  unpacked sources of packages. The version is omitted from the directory name
  for pinned packages, which are typically synchronised to a version-control
  system rather than unpacked from an archive.
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/overlay/<pkgname>/`: custom definition for the
  given pinned packages
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/build/<pkgname>.<version>/`: temporary
  directories where the packages are compiled
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/remove/<pkgname>.<version>/`: temporary
  directories used for calling the packages' `remove` commands, when those need
  the source
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/backup`: snapshots of previous states of the
  switch and other backup files

#### Pinning

Pinning is an operation by which a package definition can be created or altered
locally in a switch.

In its most simple form, `opam pin <package> <version>`. `<package>` is bound to
the specified version and won't be changed on `opam upgrade` (assuming it is an
existing package). `opam pin edit <package>` provides a way to directly pin and
edit the metadata of the given package locally to the current switch, for
example, to tweak a dependency.

`opam pin [package] <URL>` can further be used to divert the source of a
package or even create a new package. This is very useful to point to a local
path containing a development or patched version of the package source. When
pinning a package, the source is searched for metadata in an `opam` or
`<pkgname>.opam` file, either at the root of the source tree or in an `opam`
directory. You can also replace that file by a directory containing an `opam`
file and optionally other metadata, like a `files/` subdirectory.

As the `package` argument is optional, `opam` guesses the package name from the
`<URL>` or the `opam` file found. Note that for local VCS pinning, when given
without package name, `opam` retrieves the locally found `opam` file, even if not
versioned. If this file is versioned, `opam` relies on the versioned
version.

Whenever an install, reinstall or upgrade command-line refers to a pinned
package, opam first fetches its latest source. `opam
update [--development]` is otherwise the standard way to update the sources of
all the packages pinned in the current switch.

`opam install <DIR>` is an automatic way to handle pinning packages whose
definitions are found in `<DIR>`, synchronise, and install them. The `upgrade`,
`reinstall`, and `remove` commands can likewise be used with a directory argument
to refer to pinned packages.

## Common File Format

### Conventions

Syntax is given in a BNF-like notation. Nonterminals are written `<like this>`.
Terminals are either plain text or written in double-quotes (`"terminal"`), curly brackets denote zero or more repetitions when suffixed with `*`, or one or
more when suffixed with `+`, and square brackets denote zero or one occurrence.
Parentheses are for grouping. `(")` and `(""")`, respectively, mean one and three
quotation mark characters.

As a special case, and for readability, we add simplified notations for _lists_
and _options_:
- `[ <list-contents> ... ]` means
  `"[" { <list-contents> }* "]" | <list-contents>`.
  It corresponds to a case of the `<list>` nonterminal and is a list of
  `<list-contents>` repeated any number of times. The square brackets can be
  omitted when `<list-contents>` occurs just once.
- `<element> { <opt> ... }` means `<element> "{" { <opt> }* "}"` and is a
  shortcut for the `<option>` non-terminal.
- `<element> { <opt> }` means
  `<element> [ "{" <opt> "}" ]`.
  It corresponds to a specific case of the `<option>` nonterminal where there
  is exactly one element within the braces..

### General Syntax

```BNF
<file-contents> ::= { <file-item> }*
<file-item>     ::= <field-binding> | <section>
<field-binding> ::= <ident> : <value>
<section>       ::= <ident> [ <string> ] "{" <file-contents> "}"
<ident>         ::= { <identchar> }* <letter> { <identchar> }*
<varident>      ::= [ ( <ident> | "_" ) { "+" ( <ident> | "_" ) }* : ] <ident>
<identchar>     ::= <letter> | <digit>  | "_" | "-"
<letter>        ::= "a".."z" | "A".."Z"
<digit>         ::= "0".."9"
<value>         ::= <bool> | <int> | <string> | <ident> | <varident> | <operator> | <list> | <option> | "(" <value> ")"
<bool>          ::= true | false
<int>           ::= [ "-" ] { <digit> }+
<string>        ::= ( (") { <char> }* (") ) | ( (""") { <char> }* (""") )
<term>          ::= <string> | <varident>
<operator>      ::= { "!" | "=" | "<" | ">" | "|" | "&" }+ | [ ":" ] <operator> [ ":" ]
<list>          ::= "[" { <value> }* "]"
<option>        ::= <value> "{" { <value> }* "}"
<comment>       ::= ( "(*" { <char> }* "*)" ) | ( "#" { <char\newline> }* <newline> )
```

The opam file formats share a common base syntax. The
files are UTF-8 encoded and define a list of _fields_ and _sections_.

Opam uses a range of different files, each allowing their own set of fields and
sections in a specific format.

Base values can be literal Booleans, integers or strings, identifiers, and
operators. Strings allow the escapes `\"`, `\\`, `\n`, `\r`, `\b`, `\t`, as well
as three-digit decimal and two-digit hexadecimal character codes (`\NNN` and
`\xNN`), and escaped newlines. As a special case, they can be enclosed in triple
double-quotes (`"""`) so that single quotes don't need to be escaped. Lists
must be enclosed in square brackets unless they contain a single element. Values
can be followed by an argument in braces. Parentheses may be used to group
subexpressions.

Comments may be either enclosed in `(*` and `*)` or `#` and newline. They are
ignored by opam.


### Package Formulas

Package formulas are used to express requirements on the set of installed
packages.

```BNF
<package-formula> ::= <package-formula> <logop> <package-formula>
                    | ( <package-formula> )
                    | <pkgname> { { <version-formula> }* }
<logop>           ::= "&" | "|"
<pkgname>         ::= (") <ident> (")
<package>         ::= (") <ident> "." <version> (")
<version-formula> ::= <version-formula> <logop> <version-formula>
                    | "!" <version-formula>
                    | "(" <version-formula> ")"
                    | <relop> <version>
<relop>           ::= "=" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">="
<version>         ::= (") { <identchar> | "+" | "." | "~" }+ (")
```

Package names have the same restrictions as idents — only letter, digits, dash,
and underscore, and contain at least one letter — but they must be enclosed in
quotes. Versions are non-empty strings, with some restrictions on the characters
allowed.

We are using logic formulas with the operators `&` and `|`, for AND and OR, over
package names. `&` is a higher priority than `|`, so the parentheses in this
example are required:

```
("neat_package" | "also_neat_package") & "required_package"
```

Package names can be suffixed with _version constraints_, which restrict the
requirement further. Version constraints have the form `<relop> <version>` and
can be combined with binary AND `&` and OR `|`, and prefix NOT `!`. The allowed
relational operators are `=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`, and their meaning
are defined by Version Ordering. They always have higher priority than logical
operators.

> <a id="version-ordering">**Version Ordering**</a> follows the basics of the
> [Debian definition](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Version).

>
> - Version strings are sliced into alternate, possibly empty, non-digit / digit

>   `[""; 1]`, so we have `1 < a` because the non-digit component of
>   1, which is the empty string `""`, is smaller than `"a"`.
>
> - For ordering non-digit components, letters are
>   always smaller than non-letters (for example `z` < `"#"`), while
>   non-letters are compared by ASCII order.
>
> - The `~` character is special as it sorts even before the end of sequence
>   (_i.e.,_ before anything shorter: "~" sorts before "", "a~b" before "a").
>   It's most convenient for prereleases, allowing `1.0~beta` to come before
>   `1.0`.
>
> Here is an example of an ordered sequence: `~~`, `~`, `~beta2`, `~beta10`,
> `0.1`, `1.0~beta`, `1.0`, `1.0-test`, `1.0.1`, `1.0.10`, `dev`, `trunk`.

Here is a full example:

```
"foo" { >= "3.12" } & ("bar" | "baz" { !(> "2" & < "3.5") & != "5.1" })
```

### Variables

#### Usage

Variables may appear at a few different places in `opam` files and configuration.
They can be used in two forms:

- Raw idents: `foo < bar`
- Within strings, using _interpolation_, when enclosed in `%{` and `}%`:
  `"%{foo}%/bar"`

For both forms, and within values that allow them, the variables are replaced by
their contents, if any, just before the value is used. Variable contents can be
either _strings_, _Booleans_, _lists of strings_, or _undefined_, and automatic conversion may take
place using the strings `"true"` and `"false"` (leading to an _undefined_ bool
when converting from any other string). Undefined values are propagated through
Boolean expressions and lead otherwise to context-dependent default values (the
empty string or `false`, depending on the expected type, unless specified
otherwise).

The syntax`"%{var?string-if-true:string-if-false-or-undefined}%"` can be used to
insert different strings depending on the Boolean value of a variable.

Additionally, boolean package variables may be combined using the following
form: `name1+name2+name3:var` is the conjunction of `var` for each of `name1`,
`name2`, and `name3`, _i.e.,_ it is equivalent to `name1:var & name2:var &
name3:var`

#### Scopes

The defined variables depend on the specific fields being defined. There are
three scopes:

1. Global variables correspond to the general current configuration or to the
   current switch settings (system setup, opam configuration, current switch
   name, etc.). For example, `opam-version`, `arch`, or `make`.
2. Package variables have the form `package-name:var-name` and contain values
   specific to a given package. For example `foo:installed` is a Boolean
   variable that can be used to check if package `foo` is installed, and
   `foo:lib` is its library installation directory.

     `foo:bar` refers to `bar` in the installed version of `foo` and may be
     undefined if `foo` is not installed. For example, a package depending on
     `foo` can use `foo:version` to toggle different compatibility modes
     depending on the installed version of `foo`.

     One exception is references emanating from the package being defined itself.       Within `foo`'s definition, `foo:bar`, which can in this case be abridged in
     `_:bar`, always refers to the version being defined.

3. Some fields define their own local variables, like `success` and
   [`with-dev-setup`](#pkgvar-with-dev-setup) in the field
   [`post-messages`](#opamfield-post-messages). Other examples of this include
   the [`with-test`](#pkgvar-with-test), [`with-doc`](#pkgvar-with-doc), and
   [`with-dev-setup`](#pkgvar-with-dev-setup) variables, available in the
   `depends:`, `depopts:`, `build:`, `install:`, and `remove:` fields.

    Within package definition files, the variables `name` and `version`, as
    shortcuts to `_:name` and `_:version`, corresponding to the package being
    defined, are always available.

#### Pre-Defined Variables

The following variables are dynamically defined by opam but can still be
overridden from configuration. You can get the list of currently defined
variables by running:

```
opam config list # opam 2.0
opam var         # opam 2.1.0
```

#### Global Variables

- <a id="opamvar-opam-version">`opam-version`</a>:
  the version of the running opam
- <a id="opamvar-root">`root`</a>:
  the current opam root (e.g., `~/.opam`)
- <a id="opamvar-jobs">`jobs`</a>:
  opam's `jobs` (`-j`) parameter, i.e., the number of parallel builds opam is
  allowed to run
- <a id="opamvar-make">`make`</a>:
  the system's `make` command to use
- <a id="opamvar-arch">`arch`</a>:
  the host architecture, typically one of `"x86_32"`, `"x86_64"`, `"ppc32"`,
  `"ppc64"`, `"arm32"`, or `"arm64"`, or the lowercase output of `uname -m` or
  `"unknown"`
- <a id="opamvar-os">`os`</a>:
  the running OS, typically one of `"linux"`, `"macos"`, `"win32"`, `"cygwin"`,
  `"freebsd"`, `"openbsd"`, `"netbsd"`, or `"dragonfly"`, or the lowercased
  output of `uname -s` or `"unknown"`
- <a id="opamvar-os-distribution">`os-distribution`</a>:
  the distribution of the OS, one of `"homebrew"`, `"macports"` on `"macos"`,
  `"android"`, or the Linux distribution name on Linux. Equal to the value of
  `os` in other cases or if it can't be detected
- <a id="opamvar-os-family">`os-family`</a>:
  the more general distribution family, _e.g.,_ `"debian"` on Ubuntu, `"windows"`
  on Win32 or Cygwin, or `"bsd"` on all bsds. Useful, _e.g.,_ to detect the main
  package manager
- <a id="opamvar-os-version">`os-version`</a>:
  the distribution's release id, when applicable, or system otherwise

Extra variables can be defined in the file `~/.opam/config` using the
[`global-variables:`](#configfield-global-variables) (static) or
[`eval-variables`](#configfield-eval-variables) (dynamic) fields.

#### Switch Variables

The following standard paths are defined as variables in the global scope and
depend on the current switch:

- <a id="opamvar-switch">`switch`</a>:
  the name of the selected switch (or absolute directory for local switches)
- <a id="opamvar-dirs">`prefix`, `lib`, `bin`, `sbin`, `share`, `doc`, `etc`, `man`, `toplevel`, `stublibs`</a>:
  the standard directories for this switch, as configured

Additionally, two variables `user` and `group` are statically set at switch
creation time.

Extra variables can be defined in the file
`<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/switch-config`, using the
[`variables {}`](#switchconfigsection-variables) section.

#### Package Variables

These variables need to be prefixed with `<pkgname>:` or `_:`, except for
`name` and `version`, or if they can unambiguously be resolved as variables of
the package being defined.

- <a id="pkgvar-name">`name`</a>: name of the package
- <a id="pkgvar-version">`version`</a>: version of the package
- <a id="pkgvar-depends">`depends`</a>:
  resolved direct dependencies of the package
- <a id="pkgvar-installed">`installed`</a>:
  whether the package is installed
- <a id="pkgvar-enable">`enable`</a>:
  takes the value "enable" or "disable" depending on whether the package is
  installed
- <a id="pkgvar-pinned">`pinned`</a>: whether the package is pinned
- <a id="pkgvar-dirs">`bin`, `sbin`, `lib`, `man`, `doc`, `share`, `etc`</a>:
  the corresponding directories for this package (similar to
  [`<pkgname>.install`](#packagenameinstall))
- <a id="pkgvar-build">`build`</a>: directory where the package was built
- <a id="pkgvar-hash">`hash`</a>: hash of the package archive
- <a id="pkgvar-dev">`dev`</a>:
  true if this is a development package, _i.e.,_ it was not built from a release
  archive
- <a id="pkgvar-build-id">`build-id`</a>:
  a hash identifying the precise package version and metadata, and that of all
  its dependencies
- <a id="pkgvar-opamfile">`opamfile`</a>:
  if the package is installed, path of its opam file from opam internals,
  otherwise not defined

Extra variables can be defined by any package at installation time, using a
[`<pkgname>.config`](#lt-pkgname-gt-config) file with a
[`variables {}`](#dotconfigsection-variables) field.

Additionally, the following are limited to some package fields (`depends:`,
`depopts:`, `build:`, `install:`, `remove:`):

- <a id="pkgvar-with-test">`with-test`</a>: only true if tests have been
  enabled for this specific package
- <a id="pkgvar-with-doc">`with-doc`</a>: similarly for documentation
- <a id="pkgvar-with-dev-setup">`with-dev-setup`</a>: similarly for developer
  tools


The following are only available in the `depends:` and `depopts:` fields, and
are used as dependency flags (they don't have a defined `true` or `false` value
outside of a given operation):

- <a id="pkgvar-build">`build`</a>:
  limits the dependency to a build-time one, avoiding recompilation if it
  changes
- <a id="pkgvar-post">`post`</a>:
  marks the dependency as unordered, i.e., to be ignored when computing the order
  of compilations. In other words, this ensures the package will get installed
  along with the current one, but not that it will be compiled and installed
  before. This flag can be used to break dependency cycles.

### Filters

_Filters_ are formulas based on variables. Their main use is as optional
conditions to commands or command arguments, using the postfix-braces syntax:

```
[ "./configure" "--use-foo" {foo:installed} ]
```

In build instructions, this adds condition `foo:installed` to the `"--use-foo"`
argument, which will cause it to be omitted unless the variable `foo:installed`
is `true`. This is evaluated just when the command is going to be run.

```BNF
<filter> ::= <filter> <logop> <filter>
           | "!" <filter>
           | "?" <filter>
           | ( <filter> )
           | <filter> <relop> <filter>
           | <varident>
           | <string>
           | <int>
           | <bool>
```

Filters are evaluated at a certain point in time and should not be mistaken
with package formulas, which express requirements.

The following are allowed in filters:
- String, integer, and Boolean literals
- Idents
- Parentheses
- Logical operators (binary AND `&`, binary OR `|`, prefix, unary NOT `!`)
- The unary operator `?` for detecting whether a value is defined. `?expr`
  evaluates to `true`, if `expr` evaluates to a defined value, and `false` if it
  evaluates to an undefined value.
- Binary relational operators (`=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`)

The comparisons are done using [Version Order](#version-ordering), including for
integers, which are treated as strings. Relational operators have a higher
precedence than logical operators.

Undefined values are propagated through relational operators and logical
operators unless absorbed (`undef & false` is `false`, `undef | true` is
`true`). Undefined values may be detected using the `?` operator. For example,
`!(?foo & foo != bar)` requires either `foo` to be undefined or equal in value
to `bar`.

### Filtered Package Formulas

This extension to package formulas allow variables to be referenced within
version constraints and parts of the formula to be made optional. This is
evaluated as a first pass, before any action is taken, to deduce a concrete
package formula.

The definition is similar to that of `<package-formula>`, except that two cases
(`<filter>` and `<relop> <filter>`) are added to `<version-formula>`.

```BNF
<filtered-package-formula> ::= <filtered-package-formula> <logop> <filtered-package-formula>
                             | ( <filtered-package-formula> )
                             | <pkgname> { { <filtered-version-formula> }* }

<filtered-version-formula> ::= <filtered-version-formula> <logop> <filtered-version-formula>
                             | "!" <filtered-version-formula>
                             | "?" <filtered-version-formula>
                             | "(" <filtered-version-formula> ")"
                             | <relop> <version>
                             | <filter>
                             | <relop> <filter>
```

For example, a dependency on `"foo" { = version }` will require package `foo` at
the version defined by variable `version` (which is the version of the package
being defined). Conditions can be added using the same logical operators present
in pure package formulas, so one can also write `"foo" { >= "3.12" & build }`,
which makes the dependency dependent on the Boolean value of the variable
`build`.

When the version formula reduces to `false`, as would be the case here when
`build=false`, the dependency is removed from the formula.

### Interpolation

Some files can be rewritten using variable interpolation expansion. In cases
where this is available, when looking for `file` and `file.in` is found, any
`%{var}%` interpolations found in it are replaced by the contents of `var`, and
the results are written back to `file`.

This can also be done explicitly using the command `opam config subst "file"`.

### Environment Updates

Some fields define updates to environment variables in the form:

```
<ident> <update-op> <string>
```

The allowed update operators `update-op` denote how the string is applied to the
environment variable. Prepend and append operators assume list of elements
separated by an OS-specific character (`;` on Windows, `:` on Cygwin or any
other system).
- `=` override (or set if undefined)
- `+=` or `:=` prepend. They differ when the variable is unset of empty, where `:=` adds a trailing separator.
- `=+` or `=:` append. They differ when the variable is unset of empty, where `=:` adds a leading separator.
- `=+=` is similar to `+=`, except that when the variable was previously altered
  by opam. The new value will replace the old one at the same position instead
  of being put in front.

`FOO = ""` causes `FOO` to be set _but empty_ on Unix but _unset_ on Windows.

`FOO += ""`, `FOO := ""`, etc., are all ignored - i.e., opam never adds empty segments to an existing variable.

### URLs

URLs are provided as strings. They can refer to:
- Raw local filesystem paths
- SSH addresses `user@host:path`
- URLs of the form `http://`, `https://`, `ftp://`, `ssh://`, `file://`, `rsync://`
- Version control URLs for Git, Mercurial, and Darcs: `git://`, `hg://`,
  `darcs://`. This assumes http transport for `hg` and `darcs`, _i.e.,_
  `hg://` is short for `hg+http://`.
  - Note that GitHub
  [disabled](https://github.blog/2021-09-01-improving-git-protocol-security-github/)
  `git://` protocol support.
- Version control bound to a specific URL: `<vc>+<scheme>://`, e.g., `git://`,
  `hg+https://`, `git+file://`, `etc` (**NOTE:** this has been added in opam 1.2.1)

In addition, version control URLs may be suffixed with the `#` character and a
reference name (branch, commit, HEAD, etc.): `git://foo.com/git/bar#master`,
`hg+file://foo.com/hg/bar#dev1`

The URLs given for user information (e.g., package homepages and bugtrackers) are
not concerned and should just load nicely in common browsers.

### Checksums

```
<checksum> ::= (") [ "md5=" | "sha256=" | "sha512=" ] { <hexchar> }+ (")
<hexchar>  ::= "a".."f" | "A".."F" | "0".."9"
```

Checksums are specified as strings in hexadecimal form and should be prefixed
by the hashing algorithm's name (when unspecified, MD5 is assumed for
backwards compatibility only).

Additionally, the number of hexadecimal chars must match exactly what is
expected by the corresponding algorithm (resp. 32, 64, and 128 for MD5, SHA256,
and SHA512).

Until opam 2.2.0, if `openssl` was installed on the system, it would be used for
faster computation of SHA hashes.

## Specific File Formats

This section describes the precise file formats of the different kinds of files
used by opam.

### Public Configuration Files

These files are intended to be publicly distributed as part of public
repositories, initial distributions, or packages.

#### `repo`
<a id="Repospecification"></a>

The `repo` file is placed at the root of a repository and allows one to specify
some specifics of the repository. It has the following optional fields:

* <a id="repofield-opam-version">`opam-version: <string>`</a>:
  File format and repository format version, should be `2.0` as of writing.
* <a id="repofield-browse">`browse: <string>`</a>:
  A URL where the users may browse available packages online
* <a id="repofield-upstream">`upstream: <string>`</a>:
  The source that this repo is generated and maintained from. Typically, a
  version-control system address.
* <a id="repofield-redirect">`redirect: [ <string> { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  List of URLs to (permanently) redirect to if their filters evaluate to `true`.
  Can be used to serve different repositories for different OSes or different
  versions of opam. Relative URLs are supported from
  opam 2.0, but discouraged for compatibility reasons.
* <a id="repofield-archive-mirrors">`archive-mirrors: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  Archive proxy URLs specific to this repository with the same semantics as the
  similar [config field](#configfield-archive-mirrors), except a path without a
  `protocol://` prefix is accepted and will be considered relative to the
  repository root (e.g., `cache/`).
* <a id="repofield-announce">`announce: [ <string> { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  Messages that will be printed to the user on initialisation or updates of this
  repository, with optional conditions.

#### `opamrc`

This file has a format close to that of [config](#config) and can be used to
define an initial setup for opam. When running `opam init`, if `~/.opamrc` or
`/etc/opamrc` is present, or if `--config` was specified, the configuration
options from that file will be used, overriding the defaults.

The default, built-in initial config of opam can be
seen with `opam init --show-default-opamrc`.

- <a id="opamrcfield-opam-version">`opam-version: <string>`</a>:
  the file format version
- <a id="opamrcfield-repositories">`repositories: [ <string> { <URL> } { {<string>}+ } { <int> } ... ]`</a>:
  preconfigured repository names and the corresponding URLs. The last two
  optional arguments for each repository are the trust anchors (fingerprints of
  the trusted signing identities (see
  [repository-validation-command](#configfield-repository-validation-command)) and the
  quorum), _i.e.,_ how many of them are required for a signature to be accepted.
- <a id="opamrcfield-recommended-tools">`recommended-tools: [ [ <string> ... ] { <string> }  { <filter> } ... ]`</a>,
  <a id="opamrcfield-required-tools">`required-tools: [ [ <string> ... ] { <string> } { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  The tools to be checked at `opam init`. Each one of them is defined as a list
  of alternative commands to look for in the `PATH`, optionally a specific error
  message to display if none of them is found, and a filter that can make the
  check conditional.
- <a id="opamrcfield-init-scripts">`init-scripts: [ [ <string> <string> ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  These scripts will be written verbatim into the hook directory
  (`~/.opam/opam-init/hooks`) upon initialisation. The first string is the file
  name of the script, the second its raw contents, and the filter allows one to
  limit the creation of the script to specific configurations.
- [`jobs:`](#configfield-jobs),
  [`download-command:`](#configfield-download-command),
  [`download-jobs:`](#configfield-download-jobs),
  [`archive-mirrors:`](#configfield-archive-mirrors).
  [`solver-criteria:`](#configfield-solver-criteria),
  [`solver-upgrade-criteria:`](#configfield-solver-upgrade-criteria),
  [`solver-fixup-criteria:`](#configfield-solver-fixup-criteria),
  [`best-effort-prefix-criteria:`](#configfield-best-effort-prefix-criteria),
  [`solver:`](#configfield-solver),
  [`global-variables:`](#configfield-global-variables),
  [`default-compiler:`](#configfield-default-compiler),
  [`default-invariant:`](#configfield-default-invariant).
  These have the same format as the same-named fields in the [config](#config)
  file and will be imported to that file on `opam init`.
  [`default-compiler:`](#configfield-default-compiler) is additionally used to
  select the switch that will be created by `opam init` without `--bare`.

### Package Definitions

Package definitions can be a single [`opam`](#opam) file. A [`files/`](#files)
subdirectory can also be used to add files over the package source. Older
versions of opam used [`descr`](#descr) and
[`url`](#url) files besides the `opam` file, and this is still supported, but
the preferred way is now to include their information into the `opam` file
instead.

[`<pkgname>.install`](#lt-pkgname-gt-install) and
[`<pkgname>.config`](#lt-pkgname-gt-config), on the other hand, are metadata files
used by opam but that are found in the package source directory, after it has
been built.

#### opam

Package definition files, specifying a package's metadata. Usage of the `opam
lint` command is recommended to check the validity and quality of your `opam`
files.

`opam` files allow the following fields and sections:

- <a id="opamfield-opam-version">`opam-version: <string>`</a> (mandatory):
  the file format version, which should be `2.0` as of writing.

- <a id="opamfield-name">`name: <pkgname>`</a>,
  <a id="opamfield-version">`version: <version>`</a>:
  the name and version of the package. Both fields are optional when they can be
  inferred from the directory name (e.g., when the file sits in the repository),
  but they should always be set for package definitions within source trees.

- <a id="opamfield-maintainer">`maintainer: [ <string> ... ]`</a> (mandatory):
  A contact address for the package maintainer (the format `"name <email>"` is
  allowed).

- <a id="opamfield-authors">`authors: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  a list of strings listing the original authors of the software.

- <a id="opamfield-license">`license: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  The SPDX expression of the license(s) under which the source software is available
  (see http://spdx.org/licenses/). The [SPDX standard](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/SPDX-license-expressions/) allows us to define custom licenses if necessary using the `LicenseRef-your-custom-name` syntax (e.g., `license: "LicenseRef-My-Custom-Non-Commercial-License"`).
  When several licenses are defined, the combination of them is equivalent to a single license expression separated by `AND`. For instance: `license: ["MIT" "ISC"]` is equivalent to `license: "MIT AND ISC"`. 

- <a id="opamfield-homepage">`homepage: [ <string> ... ]`</a>,
  <a id="opamfield-doc">`doc: [ <string> ... ]`</a>,
  <a id="opamfield-bug-reports">`bug-reports: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  URLs pointing to the related pages for the package, for user information

- <a id="opamfield-dev-repo">`dev-repo: <string>`</a>:
  the URL of the package's source repository, which may be useful for
  developers (not to be mistaken with the URL file, which points to the
  specific packaged version).

- <a id="opamfield-tags">`tags: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  an optional list of semantic tags used to classify the packages. The
  `"org:foo"` tag is reserved for packages officially distributed by
  organisation ``foo''.

- <a id="opamfield-patches">`patches: [ <string> { <filter> } ... ]`</a>: a list
  of files relative to the project source root (often added through the `files/`
  metadata subdirectory). The listed patch files will be applied sequentially to
  the source as with the `patch` command, stripping one level of leading
  directories (`-p1`), which is what version control systems generally use.
  Variable interpolation is available, so you can specify `patches: [ "file" ]`
  to have the patch processed from `file.in`.

    Patches may be applied conditionally by adding _filters_.

- <a id="opamfield-substs">`substs: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  a list of files relative to the project source root. These files will be
  generated from their `.in` counterparts, with [variable interpolations](#Interpolation)
  expanded.

- <a id="opamfield-build">
  `build: [ [ <term> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  the list of commands that will be run in order to compile the package.

    Each command is provided as a list of terms (a command and zero, or more
    arguments). Individual terms as well as full commands can be made
    conditional by adding filters. They will be ignored if the filter evaluates
    to `false` or is undefined. Variable interpolations are also evaluated.
    These commands will be executed in sequence, from the root of a fresh
    package source tree.

    The commands executed during the `build:` stage may write exclusively to
    this source tree. They should be non-interactive and perform no network
    I/O. All libraries, syntax extensions, binaries, platform-specific
    configuration, and `package-name.config` or `package-name.install` files are
    expected to be produced within the source directory subtree, _i.e.,_ below
    the command's `$PWD`, during this step.

    The [`with-test`](#pkgvar-with-test), [`with-doc`](#pkgvar-with-doc), and
    [`with-dev-setup`](#pkgvar-with-dev-setup) variables are available in the
    scope of this field: filter testing commands with, _e.g.,_ `[make "test"]
    {with-test}`. The `dev` variable can also be useful here to detect that the
    package is not installed from a release tarball and might need additional
    preprocessing (_e.g.,_ `automake`).

    If a term is undefined (_e.g,._ an undefined variable), the empty string is
    used as positional argument.

- <a id="opamfield-install">
  `install: [ [ <term> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  the list of commands that will be run in order to install the package

    This field follows the exact same format as `build:`. It is used to move
    products of `build:` from the build directory to their final destination
    under the current `prefix`; they do any required additional setup. Commands
    in `install:` are executed sequentially from the root of the source tree
    from where the `build:` commands have been run. These commands should only
    write to subdirectories of `prefix` without altering the source directory
    itself.

    This field contains typically just `[make "install"]`. If a
    `package-name.install` is found at the source of the build directory, <span class="opam">opam</span>
    will install files from there to the prefix,
    according to its instructions after calling the commands specified in the
    `install:` field have been run, if any.

    Variables [`with-test`](#pkgvar-with-test), [`with-doc`](#pkgvar-with-doc),
    and [`with-dev-setup`](#pkgvar-with-dev-setup) are also available to the
    filters used in this field to run specific installation commands when
    tests or documentation have been requested.

- <a id="opamfield-build-doc">
  `build-doc: [ [ <term> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>,
  <a id="opamfield-build-test">
  `build-test: [ [ <term> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a> (__deprecated__):
  you should use the [`build:`](#opamfield-build) and
  [`install:`](#opamfield-install) fields with filters based on the
  [`with-test`](#pkgvar-with-test) and [`with-doc`](#pkgvar-with-doc) variables,
  to specify test and documentation specific instructions. The instructions in
  the deprecated `build-test:` are currently understood as part of the
  [`run-test:`](#opamfield-run-test) field.

- <a id="opamfield-run-test">
  `run-test: [ [ <term> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  specific instructions for running the package tests, in a format similar to
  the [`build:`](#opamfield-build) field. Run only when the package is
  explicitly installed with `--with-test`.

- <a id="opamfield-remove"> `remove: [ [ <term> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter>
  } ... ]`</a>: commands to run before removing the package in the same format
  as `build:` and `install:`.
  As of `2.0`, opam tracks the files added to the prefix during package
  installation and automatically removes them on package removal, so this
  should not be needed anymore in most cases (and may even be harmful if files
  from different packages overlap, which remove scripts generally don't handle).
  Use it for special actions, like reverting updates to files or stopping
  daemons. Removing what was just added is already taken care of.

    The commands are run from the root of a fresh copy of the package source
    unless the [`light-uninstall`](#opamflag-light-uninstall) package flag is
    present, in which case they are run from the prefix.

- <a id="opamfield-depends">`depends: [ <filtered-package-formula> ... ]`</a>:
  the package dependencies. This describes the requirements on other packages
  for this package to be built and installed. It contains a list of filtered
  package formulas, understood as a conjunction.

    The filtered package formula can access the global and switch variables but
    not variables from other packages. Additionally, special Boolean variables
    [`build`](#pkgvar-build), [`post`](#pkgvar-post),
    [`with-test`](#pkgvar-with-test), [`with-doc`](#pkgvar-with-doc), and
    [`with-dev-setup`](#pkgvar-with-dev-setup) are defined to allow limiting
    the scope of the dependency.

    * `build` dependencies are no longer needed at runtime. They won't trigger
      recompilations of your package.
    * `post` dependencies will be installed along with the package, but they are not
      required to build it. This can be used to cut build cycles of
      interdependent packages while making sure they get installed together.
      Note that, in case of failed or interrupted builds, opam can not guarantee
      the invariant that `!build` dependencies are always installed.
    * `with-test` dependencies are only needed when building tests (when the
      package is explicitly installed with `--with-test`).
    * Likewise, `with-doc` dependencies are only required when building the
      package documentation.
    * Likewise, `with-dev-setup` dependencies are only required for a developer
      tool.

- <a id="opamfield-depopts">
  `depopts: [ <pkgname> { <filtered-package-formula> } ... ]`</a>:
  the package optional dependencies. This field is similar to
  [`depends:`](#opamfield-depends) in format. It contains packages that will be
  _used_, if present, by the package being defined, either during build or
  runtime, but that are not _required_ for its installation. The implementation
  uses this information to define build order and trigger recompilations, but
  it won't automatically install _depopts_ when installing the package.

    Variables in the filtered package formula are evaluated as for
    [`depends:`](#opamfield-depends) with the same specific variables
    available (except for `post`, which wouldn't make sense).

    Note that `depopts: [ "foo" { = "3" } ]` means that the optional dependency
    only applies for `foo` version `3`, not that your package can't be installed
    with other versions of `foo`. For that, use the
    [`conflicts:`](#opamfield-conflicts) field.

- <a id="opamfield-conflicts">
  `conflicts: [ <filtered-package-formula> ... ]`</a>:
  a list of package names with optional version constraints, indicating that the
  current package can't coexist with those. Conflicts are only allowed on a
  disjunction of packages. The `&` connector is disallowed between packages or
  package versions. For example, you can conflict with `"foo" {>= "3"} | "bar"`
  but not with `"foo" {>= "3"} & "bar"` or even `"foo" {>= "3" & < "4"}`.

- <a id="opamfield-conflict-class">`conflict-class: [ <pkgname> ... ]`</a>:
  an alternate, symmetric way of defining package conflicts. Conflict classes
  defined by this field have the same syntactic constraints as package names, but  they occupy a
  different namespace. Any two packages having a common conflict class will be
  considered incompatible. This is useful to define sets of mutually conflicting
  packages.

- <a id="opamfield-depexts"> `depexts: [ [ <string> ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  the package external dependencies. This field is used to describe the
  dependencies of the package toward packages external to the <span class="opam">opam</span>
  ecosystem; <span class="opam">opam</span> will then
  use its knowledge of the system package manager to determine the availability
  of the package, and it will install these external dependencies on the system as
  prerequisites of the package, asking the user for administrator rights if
  required.

    Each `[ <string> ... ] { <filter> }` element declares the strings to the
    left as identifiers to required system-managed packages, while the filter to
    the right allows one to select the systems they will be active on.

    The filters typically use variables [`arch`](#opamvar-arch),
    [`os`](#opamvar-os), [`os-distribution`](#opamvar-os-distribution),
    [`os-version`](#opamvar-os-version), and [`os-family`](#opamvar-os-family). The
    `depexts` information can be retrieved through the `opam list --depexts`
    command (which can be targeted to a specific system other than the host by
    using the appropriate `--vars` bindings). These variables are guaranteed to
    be defined and are set to the string `"unknown"` if the detection failed.

    The `depexts:` field should preferably be used on [`conf`](#opamflag-conf)
    packages, which makes the dependencies clearer and avoids duplicating the
    efforts of documenting the appropriate system packages on the various
    OSes available.

- <a id="opamfield-messages">`messages: [ <string> { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  used to display an additional (one-line) message when prompting a solution
  implying the given package. A typical use case is to tell the user that some
  functionality will not be available as some optional dependencies are not
  installed.

- <a id="opamfield-post-messages">
  `post-messages: [ <string> { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  allows one to print specific messages to the user after the end of installation.
  The special Boolean variable `failure` is defined in the filter's scope.
  It can be used to print messages in case there was an error (typically, a
  hint on how it can be resolved or a link to an open issue). `success` is also
  defined as syntactic sugar for `!failure`. The
  [`with-dev-setup`](#pkgvar-with-dev-setup) variable is also available in this      field's scope.

- <a id="opamfield-available">`available: [ <filter> ]`</a>:
  can be used to add constraints on the OS and other global variables.
  In case the filter doesn't evaluate to `true`, the package is disabled.

    This field is evaluated before request solving or any actions take place;
    it can only refer to global variables, since it shouldn't depend on the
    current switch state. An unavailable package won't generally be seen on the
    system, except with `opam list -A`.

- <a id="opamfield-flags">`flags: [ <ident> ... ]`</a>:
  specify package flags that may alter package behaviour. Currently available
  flags are:

    - <a id="opamflag-light-uninstall">`light-uninstall`</a>:
      the package's uninstall instructions don't require
      the package source.
    - <a id="opamflag-verbose">`verbose`</a>:
      when this is present, the stdout of the package's build and
      install instructions will be printed to the user.
    - <a id="opamflag-plugin">`plugin`</a>:
      the package installs a program named `opam-<name>` and may be
      auto-installed and run with `opam <name>`.
      The convention is to name the plugin package `opam-<name>`.
    - <a id="opamflag-compiler">`compiler`</a>: the package is to be treated as
      a compiler, and it will be advertised for installing as a `compiler` package
      when creating a fresh prefix through the `opam switch` command.
    - <a id="opamflag-conf">`conf`</a>: this is a "`conf`" package that is
      intended to document capabilities of the system or the presence of
      software installed outside of opam. As such, the package may not
      include a source URL or install anything. Rather, it might just do some checks and
      fail to install if they don't pass. `conf` packages should have a name
      starting with `conf-` and include the appropriate
      [`depexts:`](#opamfield-depexts) field.
    - <a id="opamflag-avoid-version">`avoid-version`</a>: this gives the package
      version lowest priority when computing the solution to user requests. The
      priority is not only related to other versions of the same package. If all
      of a package's versions are marked with `avoid-version`, the package will
      only get installed if there are no alternatives or if asked for
      explicitely. This can be affected by the
      [solver criteria](#configfield-solver-criteria). This can be useful for
      beta releases or to discourage installation of releases with known bugs.

      Note that this behaviour is disabled when a flagged version of the package
      is already installed.
    - <a id="opamflag-deprecated">`deprecated`</a>: this flag is equivalent to
      [`avoid-version`](#opamflag-avoid-version) except for the addition of a
      deprecation message after the package is installed as well as marked as
      deprecated in the solution shown to the user upon installation.

- <a id="opamfield-features">
  `features: [ <ident> { <pkgname> { <filtered-package-formula> } ... } { <string> } ... ]`
  </a> (EXPERIMENTAL):
  This field binds given idents to dependency formulas and a documentation
  text. The intent is to allow, in the future, packages to depend on additional
  characteristics of their dependencies. This can be understood as a way to
  further document the consequences of the presence of absence of optional
  dependencies.

- <a id="opamfield-synopsis">`synopsis: <string>`</a>:
  defines a short description (one line) for the package. This can also be
  defined as the first line of an external [`descr`](#descr) file.

- <a id="opamfield-description">`description: <string>`</a>:
  defines a long description (one or more paragraphs) for the package. This can
  also be defined as the body of an external [`descr`](#descr) file.

- <a id="opamsection-url">`url "{" <url-file> "}"`</a>:
  defines the URL where the package source can be obtained. This section has
  contents in the same format as the [`url`](#url) file and has the same effect
  as using a separate `url` file.

- <a id="opamfield-setenv">`setenv: [ <environment-update> ... ]`</a>: defines
  environment variables updates that will be applied upon installing the
  package. The updates will be visible to any dependent package, as well as
  exported to the shell environment through `opam env` and `~/.opam/opam-init/`
  scripts. Note that while it is guaranteed that dependents will see the
  environment updates, and dependencies won't, other cases are unspecified. The
  order in which `setenv:` updates done by different packages are applied is
  deterministic, but they're also unspecified. In particular, it is not currently
  guaranteed to follow dependency order.

- <a id="opamfield-build-env">`build-env: [ <environment-update> ... ]`</a>:
  defines environment updates that will be applied when running the package's
  build, install, and remove scripts.

    The following environment variables are set by opam (but can be overridden by `build-env`):
    - `CDPATH=`
    - `MAKEFLAGS=`
    - `MAKELEVEL=`
    - `OPAM_PACKAGE_NAME=<pkg>` (`<pkg>` is the name of the package being built/installed/removed)
    - `OPAM_PACKAGE_VERSION=<ver>` (`<ver>` is the version of the package being built/installed/removed)
    - `OPAMCLI=2.0` (since opam 2.1)
    - `TMP` and `TMPDIR` are set by the sandbox script (bubblewrap), but they should not be relied on since the sandbox is not used on all platforms and can be disabled by the user.

- <a id="opamsection-extra-sources">`extra-source <string> "{" <url-file> "}"`</a>:
  allows the definition of extra files that need downloading into the source
  tree before the package can be patched (if necessary) and built. The format is
  similar to that of the `url` section, but here it is expected to point to a
  single file (version-controlled remotes are not allowed). The leading
  `<string>` indicates the name the file should be saved to and is relative to
  the root of the source tree.

- <a id="opamfield-extra-files">`extra-files: [ [ <string> <checksum> ] ... ]`</a>:
  optionally lists the files below `files/` with their checksums, used
  internally for integrity verifications.

- <a id="opamfield-pin-depends">`pin-depends: [ [ <package> <URL> ] ... ]`</a>:
  this field has no effect on the package repository, but it is useful for
  in-source specification of development packages. When source-pinning the
  package, either through `opam pin` or `opam install <DIR>`, opam
  will prompt to pin every specified `<package>` to the associated `<URL>`.
  There are two important limitations:

    1. If you want the pinned package be a dependency you need to add its
       `<pkgname>` to `depends:` field.
    2. `pin-depends:` are NOT transitive, that is, `pin-depends:` of packages
       getting pinned through `pin-depends:` are ignored.
    3. They won't get updated on `opam update`. The users will need to use `opam
       pin` or `opam install|upgrade DIR` again to get the new pins if the field
       has changed. Even then, this won't unpin any packages that would have
       been removed from `pin-depends:`.

- <a id="opamfield-extra-fields">`x-*: <value>`</a>:
  extra fields prefixed with `x-` can be defined for use by external tools. Opam
  will ignore them except for some search operations.

#### `descr`

Descr is a plain UTF-8 text file without specific syntactic constraints. The
first line of the file defines the package's synopsis, while the rest defines
its long description.

This information can be embedded in `opam` package definition files using the
[`synopsis:`](#opamfield-synopsis) and [`description:`](#opamfield-description)
fields since opam version 2.0. However, if a `descr` file is present alongside
the `opam` file, it takes precedence.

#### `url`

The `url` file describes the source of the package and how it may be obtained.
It has the following fields:

- One of <a id="urlfield-src">`src: <string>`</a> or
  <a id="urlfield-archive">`archive: <string>`</a>,
  specifying the URL where the package can be downloaded from. When using HTTP
  or FTP, this should be an archive. The older alternative field names
  <a id="urlfield-http">`http:`</a>,
  <a id="urlfield-local">`local:`</a>,
  <a id="urlfield-git">`git:`</a>,
  <a id="urlfield-hg">`hg:`</a> and
  <a id="urlfield-darcs">`darcs:`</a>
  are deprecated, prefer explicit URLs.

    On the official repository, this should always point to a stable archive
    over HTTP or FTP.
- <a id="urlfield-checksum">`checksum: [ <checksum> ... ]`</a>:
  the checksums of the referred-to archive to warrant integrity. At least one
  is mandatory on the official repository.
- <a id="urlfield-mirrors">`mirrors: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  an optional list of mirrors. They must use the same protocol as the main URL.

These contents can be embedded within the [`url {}`](#opamsection-url) section
of an `opam` file, which is the preferred way. You shouldn't have both a `url`
file and an `opam` file with a `url {}` section. In that case, the `url` file
will be ignored with a warning.

#### `files/`

A special subdirectory that can appear in package definition directories
alongside the `opam` file.

This subdirectory may contain any files or directories (of reasonable size) that
will be copied over the root of the package source. If already present, files
are overwritten, and directories are recursively merged. [`opam`](#opam) file
fields like [`patches:`](#opamfield-patches) refer to files at that same root,
so patches specific to opam are typically included in
this subdirectory.

Also see the [`extra-sources:`](#opamsection-extra-sources) opam section, which has
a similar behaviour and is processed before the `files/` are copied.

#### `<pkgname>.install`
<a id="packagenameinstall"></a>

This file format describes the installation from a source directory to an
installation prefix. It will be used by opam if
present at the root of the package's source directory after the `build:`
instructions have been run. It can thus be generated by the build system, be
static in the package source, or be added by opam
through the [`files/`](#files) mechanism.

To avoid duplicating efforts for managing installations, a stand-alone
`opam-installer` tool is provided with opam that can perform installations and
uninstallations from these files, or even generate corresponding shell scripts,
without requiring opam.

All the fields have the form

```
field: [ <string> { <string> } ]
```

The following take a list of filenames (relative to the root of the package
source) to be installed to the field's respective directory. An optional
relative path and destination filename can be given using the postfix braces
syntax. A leading `?` in the origin filename is stripped and informs opam to
continue silently when the file is not found.

Absolute paths, or paths referencing the parent directory (`..`), are not
allowed.

- <a id="installfield-lib">`lib:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/lib/<pkgname>/`
- <a id="installfield-lib_root">`lib_root:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/lib/` (since opam 2.0.0)
- <a id="installfield-libexec">`libexec:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/lib/<pkgname>/`, but the `exec` bit is set (since
  opam 1.2.1)
- <a id="installfield-libexec_root">`libexec_root:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/lib/`, with the `exec` bit set (since <span class="opam">opam</span> 2.0.0)
- <a id="installfield-bin">`bin:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/bin/`, with the `exec` bit set
- <a id="installfield-sbin">`sbin:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/sbin/`, with the `exec` bit set
- <a id="installfield-toplevel">`toplevel:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/lib/toplevel/`
- <a id="installfield-share">`share:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/share/<pkgname>/`
- <a id="installfield-share_root">`share_root:`</a>
  installs relative to `<prefix>/share/` (since opam 1.2.0)
- <a id="installfield-etc">`etc:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/etc/<pkgname>/`
- <a id="installfield-doc">`doc:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/doc/<pkgname>/`
- <a id="installfield-stublibs">`stublibs:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/lib/stublibs/`, with the `exec` bit set

The following are treated slightly differently:

- <a id="installfield-man">`man:`</a>
  installs relative to `<prefix>/man`, with the exception that when the
  destination is unspecified. The proper destination directory is extracted from
  the extension of the source file (so that `man: [ "foo.1" ]` is equivalent to
  `man: [ "foo.1" {"man1/foo.1"} ]`)
- <a id="installfield-misc">`misc:`</a>
  requires files to specify an absolute destination, and the user will be
  prompted before the installation is done.

#### `<pkgname>.config`

This file is used by packages to give opam specific options upon
installation. A file with this name will be installed by opam into
`<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/config/` if found at the root of the package
source tree after its installation instructions have been run.

- <a id="dotconfigfield-opam-version">`opam-version: <string>`</a>:
  the file format version.
- <a id="dotconfigfield-file-depends">`file-depends: [ "[" <string> <checksum> "]" ... ]`</a>:
  when a package defines `absolute-filename` - `hash` bindings using this field
  on state-changing operations, opam will check that the file at the given path
  still exists and has the given hash. This can be used to guarantee the
  consistency of packages that rely on system-wide files or system packages when
  those are changed, _e.g.,_ by `apt-get upgrade`. The user will be warned if the
  file was removed and the package marked for reinstallation if it was changed.
  If the checksum is zero, then the file is assumed not to exist and opam will
  detect its appearance as requiring the package to be marked for reinstallation.
- <a id="dotconfigsection-variables">`variables "{" { <ident>: ( <string> | [ <string> ... ] | <bool> ) ... }
  "}"`</a>: allows the definition of package variables that will be available
  as `<pkgname>:<varname>` to dependent packages.

### Local Configuration Files

These files are local to the opam root and managed by opam. [`config`](#config)
and [`switch-config`](#switch-config) can be manually edited to set configuration
options when opam isn't running. [`switch-state`](#switch-state) and
[`repos-config`](#repos-config) store internal state and are documented here, but they shouldn't be edited except by opam.

#### `config`

This file is stored as `~/.opam/config` and defines global configuration options
for opam. Field values can be displayed and some of
them modified with [`opam option --global`](man/opam-option.html).

- <a id="configfield-opam-version">`opam-version: <string>`</a>:
  the version of the format of this opam root, used in particular to trigger
  format migrations.
- <a id="configfield-repositories">`repositories: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  the set of configured repositories to use for newly created switches. The
  repositories themselves are set up using the
  [repos-config](#reposconfigfield-repositories) file.
- <a id="configfield-installed-switches">`installed-switches: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  lists the switches configured in this opam root, either internal or local.
  Deleted local switches are collected by opam automatically, and it is possible
  to use local switches that are not recorded in this field. It remains useful
  for cross-switch listings, repository configuration updates, or opam format
  migrations.
- <a id="configfield-switch">`switch: <string>`</a>:
  the currently globally selected switch.
- <a id="configfield-jobs">`jobs: <int>`</a>:
  the number of concurrent jobs to run for build processes. If not defined, the
  value is calculated from the number of cores.
- <a id="configfield-download-jobs">`download-jobs: <int>`</a>:
  the maximum number of concurrent downloads. The default value is 3.
- <a id="configfield-download-command">`download-command: [ ( <string> | <ident> ) { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  the command to use for downloading packages. If set to a single element, it will
  use the `curl` and `wget` presets when set to those idents, and it will use the named
  executable with a curl-compatible command line otherwise. Should otherwise be
  a full command, and in this scope, the following variables (only) are defined:
    - `opam-version` is the current opam version
    - `url` is the remote URL to fetch from
    - `out` is the expected output file
    - `retry` is the number of retries allowed
    - `compress` is whether HTTP compression should be enabled
    - `checksum` is the expected checksum of the file, including the
      `md5=`/`sha256=`/`sha512=` prefix
    - `hashalgo` is the hashing algorithm used (`md5`, `sha256`, or `sha512`)
    - `hashvalue` is the raw value of the hash, in hexa, without prefix
    - `hashpath` is a relative path that can be used for per-hash caching,
      containing hashing algorithm, two-digit prefix, and full hash value, _e.g.,_
      `md5/d4/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e`.
- <a id="configfield-archive-mirrors">`archive-mirrors: [ "<URL>" ... ]`</a>:
  defines proxy URLs that package archives can be retrieved from. The URL may
  use any supported non-version control protocol, and the files will be looked
  up by (their first) hash with the relative path.
  `<hash-algo>/<first-2-hash-characters>/<hash>`, where the hash is in
  hexadecimal. Proxies are tried in order, and the file is looked up from
  upstream if not found. They can also be configured
  [per-repository](#repofield-archive-mirrors). The command `opam admin cache`
  generates a suitable cache in `./cache` (see the [Repositories](#Repositories)
  section).
- <a id="configfield-solver-criteria">`solver-criteria: <string>`</a>: can be
  used to tweak the solver criteria used for the resolution of operations. These
  depend on the solver used (see the
  [Solver Criteria](External_solvers.html) page for details).
- <a id="configfield-solver-upgrade-criteria">`solver-upgrade-criteria: `</a>,
  <a id="configfield-solver-fixup-criteria">`solver-fixup-criteria: `</a>:
  similar to [`solver-criteria`](#configfield-solver-criteria) but specific to
  some actions.
- <a id="configfield-best-effort-prefix-criteria">`best-effort-prefix-criteria: `</a>, this
  is the string that must be prepended to the criteria when the `--best-effort`
  option is set and is expected to maximise the `opam-query` property in the
  solution. For recent `aspcud`, this can be, e.g., `+sum(solution,opam-query),`.
  A valid setting for `mccs` is `+count[opam-query:,false],`.
- <a id="configfield-solver">`solver: [ ( <string> | <ident> ) { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  the solver to use. See the
  [External Solvers](Install.html#ExternalSolvers) section of the install guide
  for context. If set to a single `<ident>` element that may point to a
  built-in solver or one of the `aspcud`, `packup`, or `mccs` predefined
  command-lines. Otherwise, the following variables are defined in the command
  scope:
    - `input` is the name of the input file in [Cudf](http://mancoosi.org/cudf/) format.
    - `output` is the expected name of the output file containing the solution.
    - `criteria` is the defined solver criteria.
- <a id="configfield-global-variables">`global-variables: [ "[" <ident> ( <string> | [ <string> ... ] | <bool> ) <string> "]" ... ]`</a>
  allows the definition of global variables. The last `<string>` is for
  documentation and is shown in the output of `opam config list`.
- <a id="configfield-eval-variables">`eval-variables: [ "[" <ident> [ <string> ... ] <string> "]" ... ]`</a>
  allows the definition of global variables that will be lazily initialised to
  the output of the given command. The last `<string>` documents the variable.
- <a id="configfield-pre-build-commands">`pre-build-commands: [ [ <term> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>,
  <a id="configfield-pre-install-commands">`pre-install-commands: [ [ <term> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>, and
  <a id="configfield-pre-remove-commands">`pre-remove-commands: [ [ <term> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>
  specify commands that will be run just before processing the package's commands
  for the corresponding action on any package. The filters are evaluated in the
  same scope as the package commands.
- <a id="configfield-wrap-build-commands">`wrap-build-commands: [ [ <term> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>,
  <a id="configfield-wrap-install-commands">`wrap-install-commands: [ [ <term> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>, and
  <a id="configfield-wrap-remove-commands">`wrap-remove-commands: [ [ <term> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>
  specify wrappers around every command executed during the corresponding action
  of any package. The command-line elements will be prefixed to the package
  command, so for example, the command `[ make "install" ]` with wrapper
  `[ "time" "-o" "/tmp/timings" "-a" ]` will result in the command `[ "time"
  "-o" "/tmp/timings" "-a" make "install" ]`. The filters are evaluated in the
  same scope as the package commands.

    As [`init-scripts:`](#opamrcfield-init-scripts) are stored in the hook
    directory when using a wrapper script defined by
    [`init-scripts:`](#opamrcfield-init-scripts), use the variable `%{hook}%` as
    prefix for you script filename.
- <a id="configfield-post-build-commands">`post-build-commands: [ [ <term> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>,
  <a id="configfield-post-install-commands">`post-install-commands: [ [ <term> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>, and
  <a id="configfield-post-remove-commands">`post-remove-commands: [ [ <term> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>
  specify commands that will be run just after processing the package's commands
  for the corresponding action, and the `<pkgname>.install` file in the case of
  install and remove, on any package. The post commands are run whether or not
  the package script succeeded. The filters are evaluated in the same scope as
  the package commands, with the addition of the variable `error-code`, which is
  the return value of the package script, and `hooks`, which is the directory
  where scripts created using `opamrc`'s
  [`init-scripts:`](#opamrcfield-init-scripts) field are created.

    The `post-install-commands` hook also has access to an extra variable,
    `installed-files`, which expands to the list of files and directories added or
    modified during the installation of the package.
    Note that this hook is run after the scan for installed files completes, so any additional installed files won't be recorded and must be taken
    care of by a `pre-remove-commands` hook. However, modified or deleted installed
    files during the `post-install-commands` will be handled correctly by `opam`.
- <a id="configfield-pre-session-commands">`pre-session-commands: [ [ <term> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>,
  <a id="configfield-post-session-commands">`post-session-commands: [ [ <term> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  These commands will be run once, respectively, before and after the sequence of
  actions done by a given instance of opam. Only the switch variables are
  available since this doesn't concern one single package, plus the following,
  related to the sequence of actions. They correspond respectively to the
  expected final state for `pre-session` and to the actually reached state
  for `post-session`.
    - `installed`: all installed packages with versions
    - `new`: all packages or versions that are getting installed but weren't
      present before the session
    - `removed`: all packages or versions that were installed before, but no
      longer after, the session. Note that an upgrade of `foo.0.1` to `foo.0.2` is considered
      as removal of `foo.0.1` and addition of `foo.0.2`. Reinstallations aren't
      visible with these variables.
    - `success` (and `failure`, which is `!success`): only for `post-session`.
      `success` is `true` only if all the expected operations were successful (a
      subset of the package actions may have been successful even if `false`).
    - `depexts`: for `pre-session`, the list of
      [`depexts:`](#opamfield-depexts) inferred for the host system on
      `installed`
    - `hooks`: the directory where scripts created using `opamrc`'s
      [`init-scripts:`](#opamrcfield-init-scripts) field are created

    In addition, the output of these hooks is printed to the user, so
    `post-session-commands` may be used to output extra information upon session
    completion.

- <a id="configfield-repository-validation-command">`repository-validation-command: [ <term> { <filter> } ... ]`</a>
  defines a command to run on the upstream repositories to validate their
  authenticity. When this is specified, and for repositories that define
  [trust anchors](#opamrcfield-repositories), opam will refuse any update that
  doesn't pass this validation. The command should return 0 on successful
  validation, and the following opam variables are made available:
    - `anchors`: comma-separated list of fingerprints
    - `quorum`: integer, the currently defined quorum
    - `repo`: directory containing the already-validated state of the repository
      (empty for an initial validation)
    - `patch`: for incremental validation, filename of a patch applying to
      `repo` (with `patch -p1`) and that needs verification
    - `dir`: for initial validation, the directory to verify
    - `incremental`: `false` if doing an initial validation based on `dir`,
      `true` for an incremental validation based on `repo` and `patch`.

    Since there are two modes (initial and incremental), all variables may not be
    defined in all cases.

- <a id="configfield-default-compiler">`default-compiler: [ <package-formula> ... ]`</a>:
  a list of compiler package choices. On `opam init`, the first available
  compiler in the list will be chosen for creating the initial switch if
  `--bare` wasn't specified. Note that `default-invariant:` will still be used,
  so the alternatives listed here should be compatible with it.

- <a id="configfield-default-invariant">`default-invariant: [ <package-formula> ... ]`</a>:
  the default switch invariant that will be set on newly created switches, in
  cases where nothing else was specified.

- <a id="configfield-depext">`depext: <bool>`</a>:
  enable or disable system dependency handling. When packages declare
  dependencies on system packages using the [depexts](#opamfield-depexts) field
  (typically, bindings to C libraries like SDL require the library to be
  installed, which is outside the scope of opam), if this is set to `true` (the
  default), opam will check the availability of such dependencies using the host
  system package manager, and prompt the user to install them when needed.

- <a id="configfield-depext-run-installs">`depext-run-installs: <bool>`</a>:
  if `true` (the default), opam is allowed to run installations through the host
  system package manager (_e.g.,_ `apt`, `yum`, or `brew`) when required for the
  installation of opam packages through their [depexts](#opamfield-depexts).
  This is generally done through `sudo` and always after prompting the user
  (unless `--yes` was specified). If disabled, the installation command is
  printed to stdout, and opam pauses to let the user proceed.

- <a id="configfield-depext-cannot-install">`depext-cannot-install: <bool>`</a>:
  instructs opam that no system package can be installed on the system. Any opam
  package declaring system dependencies towards a system package that is not yet
  installed will be marked as unavailable.

- <a id="configfield-depext-bypass">`depext-bypass: [ <string> ... ] `</a>:
  assume the listed system packages to be already installed, bypassing the
  checks normally done when `depext` is enabled.

- <a id="configfield-swh-fallback">`swh-fallback: <bool>`</a>:
  If `true`, opam tries to retrieve a unreachable package source from the [Software
  Heritage](www.softwareheritage.org) archive, if the `swhid` is present in the
  opam file.

#### `switch-config`

This file is located in `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/switch-config` and
contains configuration options specific to that switch:

- <a id="switchconfigfield-opam-version">`opam-version: <string>`</a>:
  the file format version.
- <a id="switchconfigfield-synopsis">`synopsis: <string>`</a>:
  a short description for the switch, shown when listing. By default, this is
  initialised to the synopsis of the chosen compiler package.
- <a id="switchconfigfield-repos">`repositories: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  lists the repositories in use in this switch, higher priority first. The
  repository names should correspond to configured repositories in
  `~/.opam/repo` (they are otherwise ignored). If unset, the
  [set of repositories](#configfield-repositories) from the global configuration
  is used.
- <a id="switchconfigfield-opam-root">`opam-root: <string>`</a>:
  the opam root the switch belongs to. Used for local switches to avoid
  automatically selecting a switch belonging to a different opam root.
- <a id="switchconfigfield-setenv">`setenv: [ <environment-update> ... ]`</a>:
  defines environment variable updates that will be applied whenever in this
  switch (both in the environment where packages are built and in the
  environment exported by opam through `opam env`)
- [`pre-build-commands:`](#configfield-pre-build-commands),
  [`pre-install-commands:`](#configfield-pre-install-commands),
  [`pre-remove-commands:`](#configfield-pre-remove-commands),
  [`pre-session-commands:`](#configfield-pre-session-commands):
  as the corresponding [global config](#config) fields.
- [`wrap-build-commands:`](#configfield-wrap-build-commands),
  [`wrap-install-commands:`](#configfield-wrap-install-commands),
  [`wrap-remove-commands:`](#configfield-wrap-remove-commands):
  as the corresponding [global config](#config) fields.
- [`post-build-commands:`](#configfield-post-build-commands),
  [`post-install-commands:`](#configfield-post-install-commands),
  [`post-remove-commands:`](#configfield-post-remove-commands),
  [`post-session-commands:`](#configfield-post-session-commands):

- <a id="switchconfigsection-paths">`paths "{" { <ident>: <string> ... } "}"`</a>
  defines the standard paths within the switch. Recognised fields include
  `prefix:`, `bin:`, `sbin:`, `lib:`, `share:`, `etc:`, `doc:`, `man:`,
  `stublibs:`, `toplevel:`.
- <a id="switchconfigsection-variables">`variables "{" { <ident>: ( <string> | [ <string> ... ] | <bool> ) ... } "}"`</a>
  allows the definition of variables local to the switch.

As [config](#config), field values can be displayed and some of them modified
with [`opam option`](man/opam-option.html).

#### `switch-state`

This file, located at `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/switch-state`, is used by
opam to store the current state of a switch. All
fields are lists of `<package>` (_i.e.,_ `[ "<pkgname>.<version>" ... ]`).

- <a id="switchstatefield-opam-version">`opam-version: <string>`</a>:
  the file format version.
- <a id="switchstatefield-compiler">`compiler: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  the package that form the base of the current switch. They won't be affected
  by `opam upgrade` and are protected against deletion.
- <a id="switchstatefield-roots">`roots: [ <string> ... ]`</a>
  lists the package "roots", _i.e.,_ packages that have been installed manually
  by the user (as opposed to the ones which got installed to fulfil
  dependencies). Note that packages in this list may not be installed if they
  were removed due to build failures.
- <a id="switchstatefield-installed">`installed: [ <string> ... ]`</a>
  lists all currently installed packages.
- <a id="switchstatefield-pinned">`pinned: [ <string> ... ]`</a>
  lists all packages which have been pinned, and to what version. If an overlay
  package definition is present in
  `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/overlay/<pkgname>/`, that can be used to alter
  the package definition and modify its source URL. Otherwise, the package is
  simply pinned to the given version.

#### `repos-config`

This file is at `~/.opam/repo/repos-config` and lists all package repositories
configured on the system and their source URLs.

- <a id="reposconfigfield-repositories">`repositories: [ <string> { <URL> } { {<string>}+ } { <int> } ... ]`</a>
  lists the configured repository idents, their URLs, and trust anchors. The
  format is similar to [repositories:](#opamrcfield-repositories) from `opamrc`,
  except that the `<URL>` itself is optional.

Note that repositories without URLs can be used. In this case, the corresponding
subdirectory in `~/.opam/repo/` is supposed to be put in place and updated by
the user, so opam will never write to it and won't cache its contents.
