## Tl;dr

Create a local package from the current directory

```
$ opam pin add <name> .
```

Get a local copy of an existing package and install from there

```
$ opam source <package> --pin
```

Get it back to normal

```
$ opam pin remove <package>
```

Publish to the OPAM repository:
* Use the [opam-publish](https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-publish#opam-publish)
  tool (`opam install opam-publish`)
* Or by hand:
    - Fork [https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository)
    - Add your `opam`, `descr` and `url` files to
      `packages/<pkgname>/<pkgname>.<version>`
    - File a [pull request](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/compare/)


# Creating OPAM packages

An OPAM package is basically a bunch of data about a software project:
* A name, version and description
* Some dependencies and constraints on other packages, compiler versions, etc.
* Build, install and remove instructions
* Some additional information (bugtracker, homepage, license, doc...)

This document will go through a simple way to get it in the right format, whether
you are packaging your own project or someone else's. It's not a complete guide
to the opam file format.


## Creating a local package

We'll be assuming that you have a working OPAM installation. If not, please
first read the [install guide](Install.html).


### Get the source

Let's start from the root directory of your project source, typically obtained
from a version-controlled repository or from a tarball.

```
$ wget https://.../project.tar.gz && tar xvzf project.tar.gz
# Or
$ git clone git://.../project.git
...
$ cd project
```

### Opam pin

OPAM 1.2 provides a feature that allows you to register packages locally,
without the need for them to exist in a repository. We call this __pinning__,
because it is an extension of the very common feature that allows to __pin__ a
package to a specific version number in other package managers.

So let's create a package __pinned__ to the current directory. We just need to
choose a name and issue the command:

```
$ opam pin add <project> . -n
```
(`-n` tells OPAM to not try and install just yet, we'll get to it later)


### The "opam" file

At this stage, OPAM will be looking for metadata for the package `<project>`, on
its repository and in the source directory. Not finding any, it will open an
editor with a pre-filled template for your package's `opam` file. It's best to
keep the project's `README` file open at this stage, as it should contain the
information we're interested in, only in a less normalised format.

```
opam-version: "1.2"
name: "project"
version: "0.1"
maintainer: "Name <email>"
author: "Name <email>"
homepage: ""
bug-reports: ""
license: ""
dev-repo: ""
build: [
  ["./configure" "--prefix=%{prefix}%"]
  [make]
]
install: [make "install"]
remove: ["ocamlfind" "remove" "project"]
depends: "ocamlfind"
```

The `opam-version`, `maintainer` and `version` fields are mandatory ; you should
remove the others rather than leave them empty.
* You'll probably be the `maintainer` for now, so give a way to contact you in
  case your package needs maintenance.
* Most interesting is the `build` field, that tells OPAM how to compile the
  project. Each element of the list is a single command in square brackets,
  containing arguments either as a string (`"./configure"`) or a variable name
  (`make`, defined by default to point at the chosen "make" command -- think
  `$(MAKE)` in Makefiles). `%{prefix}%` is another syntax to replace variables
  within strings. `opam config list` will give you the list of available
  variables.
* `install` is similar to `build`, but tells OPAM how to install. This is indeed
  `install: [ [make "install"] ]`, but the extra square brackets are optional
  when there is a single element, just add them if you need more than one
  command.
* `remove` is similar to `build` and `install`, but tells OPAM how to uninstall.
* `depends` should be a list of existing OPAM package names that your package
  relies on to build and run. You'll be guaranteed those are there when you
  execute the `build` instructions, and won't be changed or removed while your
  package is installed.

A few other fields are available, but that should be enough to get started. Like
`install` and `remove`, most fields may contain lists in square brackets rather
than a single element: `maintainer`, `author`, `homepage`, `bug-reports`,
`license` and `depends`.

For the list of available fields and specification of the format, see the
[OPAM manual](Manual.html#opam).

One you save and quit, OPAM will syntax-check and let you edit again in case of
errors.


## Installing

The best test is to let OPAM attempt to install your just created package. As
for any package, you do it by hand with:

```
$ opam install <project> --verbose
```

At this point, OPAM will get a snapshot of the project, resolve its dependencies
and propose a course of actions for the install. Let it go and see if your
project installs successfully ; it's a good idea to use `--verbose` as it will
make OPAM print the output of the externals commands, in particular the ones in
the `build` instructions.

You can now check that everything is installed as expected. Do also check that
`opam remove <project>` works properly.

If you need to change anything, simply do

```
$ opam pin edit <project>
```

to get back to editing the `opam` file. Manually editing the `opam` file in
your source tree also works.

So far, so good ! You may have missed dependencies in case they were already
installed on your system, but that will be checked automatically by the
continuous integration system when you attempt to publish your package to the
OPAM repository, so don't worry.


## Getting a full OPAM package

There are still two things missing for a complete package.
* An appealing description.
* An URL where OPAM may download the project source for the release. If your
  project is hosted on Github, pushing `TAG` will automatically provide
  https://github.com/me/project/archive/TAG.tar.gz.

[opam-publish](https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-publish) is a tool that automates
most of the steps to get a full package ready, reviewed and published.

### With opam-publish

```
$ opam install opam-publish
$ opam-publish prepare <URL>
```

This will provide you with a `<package>.<version>` directory, where you'll have to
write a description within the `descr` file if your package is new. Check the
files in that directory, it's the full contents of what will be included in the
opam repository.

### By hand

* Write a cool description of your package within a simple utf-8 text file
  `descr`. Like for git commits, the first line is a short summary, and a longer
  text may follow.
* Create a `url` file, with a format similar to that of `opam`:

    ```
    archive: "https://address/of/project.1.0.tar.gz"
    checksum: "3ffed1987a040024076c08f4a7af9b21"
    ```

  The checksum is a simple md5 of the archive, which you can obtain with:

    ```
    $ curl -L "https://address/of/project.1.0.tar.gz" | md5sum
    ```


## Publishing

Publishing is currently handled through Github, using the pull-request
mechanism. If you're not familiar with it, it is a fancy way to:
* Make a patch to the OPAM repository
* Propose this patch for review and integration. This will also trigger tests
  that your package installs successfully from scratch.

Opam-publish will take care of this for you and, just requiring that you have an
account on Github, direct you to the web interface where you can follow the
process of integration and discuss issues with the maintainers.

### With opam-publish

It's just, from the same directory as above:

```
opam-publish submit <package>.<version>
```

This will perform some checks on your package, and, if all goes well, you'll be
redirected to the github page that will track your pull-request (automated
tests, discussion with the repository maintainers, etc.). If any modifications
were requested, re-running the command will automatically update the existing
pull-request.

### By hand

Here is how to do it from scratch:

1.  Go to https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository and hit the `Fork` button on
    the top right corner (you may be asked to login or register)

2.  Get the `clone URL` on the right, and, from the shell, run `git clone <url>`
    to get your local copy

3.  Now we'll add the new package description (`opam`, `descr` and `url` files)
    into `opam-repository/packages/<project>/<project>.<version>/` and make that
    a git commit:

    ```
    $ cd opam-repository/packages
    $ mkdir -p <project>/<project>.<version>
    $ cp <project-src>/opam <project>/<project>.<version>
    $ cp <path-to>/url <path-to>/descr <project>/<project>.<version>
    $ git add <project>
    $ git commit -m "Added new fancy <project>.<version>"
    ```

4.  Sending that back to github is just a matter of running `git push`

5.  Back to the web interface, refresh, hit the `Pull request` button, check your
    changes and confirm;

6.  Wait for feedback !

### Once you are done

Don't forget to `opam pin remove <project>` once your project is on the
repository, if you don't want to continue using your local version. Remember
that as long as the package is pinned, OPAM will use the metadata found in its
source if any, but otherwise only what is in the OPAM repository matters. Use
`git pin list` to list all currently pinned packages.

## Some tricks

* You may skip the first step and pin to a remote version-controlled
  repository directly, using for example

    ```
    $ opam pin add <project> git://github.com/me/project.git
    ```

* OPAM will propose to save your opam file back to your source, but if you want
  to take a peek at the internal version it's at
  `~/.opam/<switch>/overlay/<project>/`. You may also check it with `opam show
  --raw`.
* Since 1.2.1, OPAM will also use files `<package>.opam`, or metadata found in a
  subdirectory `opam` or `<package>.opam` in your source tree. This can be
  useful if different OPAM packages are built from the same source.
* You can set OPAM to use your local clone of the repository with

    ```
    $ opam repository add my-dev-repo path/to/opam-repository
    ```
  Don't forget to `opam pin remove <project>`, and test your changes to the repo
  directly. You'll also need to `opam update my-dev-repo` each time to keep OPAM
  in sync (`opam update` synches all repos, this will be faster).

* Pins can also be used to try out experimental changes to a project with
  minimal effort: you can pin to a git repository and even to a specific branch,
  tag or hash by adding `#BRANCH` to the target. So say you want to try out
  Joe's GitHub pull-request present on his branch `new-feature` on his fork of
  `project`, just do

    ```
    $ opam pin project git://github.com/Joe/project.git#new-feature
    ```
  and OPAM will use that to get the source (and possibly updated metadata) of
  the package; this works with any branch of any git repo, it's not github
  specific.
* We've been focusing on git above, but OPAM can handle darcs and mercurial
  repositories too, using `darcs://` and `hg://`.

## More on opam files

The opam files can express much more than what was shown above. Without getting
into too much details, here are some of the most useful features:

* **Version constraints**: an optional version constraint can be added after any
  package name in `depends`: simply write `"package" {>= "3.2"}`. Warning,
  versions are strings too, don't forget the quotes.
* **Formulas**: depends are by default a conjunction (all of them are required),
  but you can use the logical "and" `&` and "or" `|` operators, and even group
  with parentheses. The same is true for version constraints: `("pkg1" & "pkg2") |
  "pkg3" {>= "3.2" & != "3.7"}`.
* **Build depends**: you may add the key `build` in front of the version
  constraints, e.g. `"package" {build & >= "3.2"}`, to indicate that there is no
  run-time dependency to this package: it is required but won't trigger rebuilds
  of your package when changed.
* **Test depends**: similarly to the `build` key above, you may also add the key
  `test` in front of the version constraints, e.g. `"package" {test & >= "3.2"}`,
  to indicate that this dependency is only required to build the tests.
* **OS and OCaml constraints**: The `available` field is a formula that
  determines your package availability based on the operating system
  (OS), OCaml version or other constraints. For example:

    ```
    available: [ os != "darwin" | ocaml-version >= "4.00" ]
    ```
* **Conflicts**: some packages just can't coexist. The `conflicts` field is a
  list of packages, with optional version constraints.
* **Optional dependencies**: they change the way your package builds, but are
  not mandatory. The `depopts` field is a simple list of package names. If you
  require specific versions, add a `conflicts` field with the ones that won't
  work.
* **Variables**: you can get a list of predefined variables that you can use in
  your opam rules with `opam config list`.
* **Filters**: full commands, or single commands arguments, may need to be
  omitted depending on the environment. This uses the same optional argument
  syntax as above, postfix curly braces, with boolean conditions:

    ```
    ["./configure" "--with-foo" {ocaml-version > "3.12"} "--prefix=%{prefix}%"]
    [make "byte"] { !ocaml-native }
    [make "native"] { ocaml-native }
    ```
