# OPDP = Opam Package Description Protocol

This document describes the communication protocol between OPAM the
dose3 library. The protocol is called OPDP, for "Opam Package 
Description Protocol".

### Scenario

A scenario is a text file encoded in a format very similar to the 822 Mail
format.  A scenario consists of two distinct parts: a **request** and a
**package universe**, occurring in that order. The request consists of a single
stanza, while the package universe consists of several such stanzas. All
stanzas occurring in a scenario are separated by an empty line.

#### Request
Within a dependency solving scenario, a request represents the action on
installed packages requested by the user.

A request is a single 822 stanza opened by a mandatory Request field
and followed by a mixture of action, preference, and global
configuration fields.

The value of the **Request:** field is a string describing the OPDP
protocol which will be used to communicate. At present, the string must
be `OPDP 0.1`. Request fields are mainly used to identify the beginning
of a request stanza; their actual values are otherwise not used by the
OPDP protocol.

The following **configuration fields** are supported in request stanzas:

- **Switch:** (mandatory) The name of the *current* opam switch as selected
  by the user (see also: `opam switch`)

- **Switches:** (optional, defaults to the current switch) A
  space separated list of *all* switches installed on the system by Opam (
  see: `opam switch -i`)

- **Profiles:** (optional, default empty list) A space separated list of
  labels used to filter dependencies

The following **action fields** are supported in request stanzas:

- **Install:** (optional, defaults to the empty string) A comma separated list
  of switch-qualified package names possibly associate with a version
  constraint. This field denotes a list of packages that the user wants to
  install, usually via an opam `install` request.

- **Remove:** (optional, defaults to the empty string) Same syntax of
  Install. This field denotes a list of packages that the user wants to
  remove, usually via opam `remove` or `purge` requests.

- **Upgrade:** (optional, defaults to the empty string) A comma
  separated list of package names, optionally qualified by a switch.
  This field denotes the list of packages to be upgraded, on one, or all
  switches, usually requested via an opam `upgrade` request.

The following **preference fields** are supported in request stanzas:

- **Preferences:** a solver-specific optimization string. Ex "-removed,-new"

#### Package universe

A package universe is a list of 822 stanzas, one per package, called
**package stanzas**. Each package stanzas starts with a Package
field. The following fields are supported in package stanzas:

- **Package:** (mandatory) The package name

- **Version:** (mandatory) The package version

- **Switch:** (optional, default to all available switches "all") A comma
  separated list of switches for which this package will be considered. The
  special value "all" means "on all available switches".

- **Depends:** (optional, default to the empty string) A list of dependencies
  in CNF format ( commas denotes ANDs and bars denotes ORs ) of package names
  optionally switch-qualified or optionally decorated with a version constraint.
  A special decoration `:any` can be attached to a package name to denote that
  the constraint on this package can be satisfied by any packages with that
  package name installed on any installed switches. A dependency can be also
  decorated by two types of annotations : switch annotations and profile
  annotations. The switch annotations is a list of switches using [ as the
  opening and ] as the closing bracket. The dependency will be considered if one
  of the specified switches are active.

  Depends: foo (>= 1.0) [4.02 3.11] <!windows> <!multithread>, bar

  This specification uses a pair of brackets (using < as the opening and > as
  the closing bracket) after the switch qualification list. The < and > brackets
  enclose a white space separated list of terms called a restriction list. But in
  contrast to the switch qualification there can be multiple < and > enclosed
  restriction lists. The list of restriction lists is called a restriction
  formula and individual restriction lists are separated by white space.

  Every term in a restriction list refers to the name of a profile. Terms can be
  negated by using an exclamation mark as a prefix. Positive and negative terms
  are allowed to be mixed.

  The terms arranged as a restriction formula form a disjunctive normal form
  expression. This is, each term within a restriction list is AND-ed together
  while the restriction lists in a restriction formula are OR-ed together (the
  order does not matter). A term evaluates to "true" if the profile with the same
  name was set by the user. It defaults to false if the profile was not set. In
  the example above, the package would depend on foo for 4.02 or 3.11 and if
  neither the profile windows nor the profile multithread are active. 

  Depends: foo <linux ssl>

  In this example the dependency foo would be considered if only both linux and ssl
  profiles are set.

  Depends: foo <linux ssl> <!windows>

  In this example the dependency foo would be considered if only both linux and ssl
  profiles are set or the windows profile is not set.

  If a build dependency is annotated with a restriction formula, then that
  dependency is included if and only if the condition expressed by the
  conjunctive normal form expression evaluates to true.

- **Conflicts:** (optional, default to the empty string) A list of conflicts in
  conjunctive format ( commas denotes ANDs ). Annotations as in Depends.

- **Build-Depends:** (optional, default to the empty string) A list of
  dependencies in CNF format ( commas denotes ANDs and bars denotes ORs ) of names.
  These packages will not be considered by the dependency solver and refer to
  system packages.

- **Installed:** (optional, default to the empty string) A comma
  separated list of switches denoting the installed switches where this package is
  currently installed.

- **Holds:** (optional, defaults to empty list). A comma separated list of hold
  statements. Allowed values: `<switch>:yes`, `<switch>:no`. When set to
  `<switch>:yes`, the corresponding package is marked as "on hold" by opam on
  the specified switch.

#### Solution

A solution is a list of 822 stanzas. Each of them could be an
install stanza (telling Opam to install a specific package), a remove
stanza (telling Opam to remove one).

An **install stanza** starts with an Install field and supports the
following fields:

- **Install:** (mandatory). The value is a triplet, a package name, 
  followed by a package version, followed by a switch identifier.

- All fields supported by package stanzas.

**Remove stanzas** are similar to install stanzas, but have **Remove**
fields instead of Install fields. 

## Example

Request:
Install: a:4.01 ( = 1 ) | a (<= 2)
Upgrade: b
Switch: 3.12
Switches: 4.01

Package: a
Version: 1
Switches: 4.01 , 3.12
Depends: b ( <= 2), c:4.02 | d, e:any
Build-Depends: sed, tar

[...]
