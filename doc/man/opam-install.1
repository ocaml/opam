.SH NAME
.P
opam\-install \- Install a list of packages.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fBopam install\fR [\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIPACKAGES\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
This command installs one or more packages to the currently selected compiler. To install packages for another compiler, you need to switch compilers using \fBopam switch\fR. You can remove installed packages with \fBopam remove\fR, and list installed packages with \fBopam list \-i\fR. See \fBopam pin\fR as well to understand how to manage package versions.
.P
This command will make opam use the dependency solver to compute the transitive closure of dependencies to be installed, and will handle conflicts as well. If the dependency solver returns more than one solution, opam will arbitraty select the first one. If dependencies are to be installed, opam will ask if the installation should really be performed.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 4
\fIPACKAGES\fR
List of package names.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 4
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-keep\-build\-dir\fR
Keep the build directory. This is equivalent to setting \fB$OPAMKEEPBUILDIR\fR to a non\-empty string.
.TP 4
\fB\-m\fR \fIMAKE\fR, \fB\-\-make\fR=\fIMAKE\fR
Use \fIMAKE\fR as the default 'make' command.
.TP 4
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-checksums\fR
Do not verify the checksum of downloaded archives. This is equivalent to setting \fB$OPAMNOCHECKSUMS\fR to a non\-empty string.
.SH COMMON OPTIONS
.P
These options are common to all commands.
.TP 4
\fB\-\-debug\fR
Print debug message on stdout. This is equivalent to setting \fB$OPAMDEBUG\fR to a value greater or equal to 2.
.TP 4
\fB\-\-help\fR[=\fIFMT\fR] (default=pager)
Show this help in format \fIFMT\fR (pager, plain or groff).
.TP 4
\fB\-\-no\-base\-packages\fR
Do not install base packages (useful for testing purposes). This is equivalent to setting \fB$OPAMNOBASEPACKAGES\fR to a non\-empty string.
.TP 4
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Be quiet when installing a new compiler.
.TP 4
\fB\-r\fR \fIROOT\fR, \fB\-\-root\fR=\fIROOT\fR (absent=/Users/tgazagna/.opam)
Use \fIROOT\fR as the current root path. This is equivalent to setting \fB$OPAMROOT\fR to \fIROOT\fR.
.TP 4
\fB\-s\fR \fISWITCH\fR, \fB\-\-switch\fR=\fISWITCH\fR
Use \fISWITCH\fR as the current compiler switch. This is equivalent to setting \fB$OPAMSWITCH\fR to \fISWITCH\fR.
.TP 4
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be more verbose. This is equivalent to setting either \fB$OPAMDEBUG\fR to a value greater or equal to 1 or \fB$OPAMVERBOSE\fR to a non\-empty string.
.TP 4
\fB\-\-version\fR
Show version information.
.TP 4
\fB\-y\fR, \fB\-\-yes\fR
Disable interactive mode and answer yes to all questions that would otherwise be asked to the user. This is equivalent to setting \fB$OPAMYES\fR to a non\-empty string.
