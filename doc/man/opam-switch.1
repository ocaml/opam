.SH NAME
.P
opam\-switch \- Manage multiple installation of compilers.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fBopam switch\fR [\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fICOMMAND\fR] [\fIARG\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
This command allows to switch between different compiler versions, installing the compiler if \fBopam switch\fR is used to switch to that compiler for the first time. The different compiler versions are totally independant from each other, meaning that OPAM maintains a separate state (e.g. list of installed packages...) for each.
.P
See the documentation of \fBopam switch list\fR to see the compilers which are available, and how to switch or to install a new one.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 4
\fICOMMAND\fR
Name of the sub\-command. See the \fBCOMMANDS\fR section for more info. If a compiler switch is given instead of an usual command, this command will switch to the given compiler. You will then need to run \fBeval `opam config env`\fR to update your environment variables.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 4
\fB\-a\fR \fICOMP\fR, \fB\-\-alias\-of\fR=\fICOMP\fR
The name of the compiler description which will be aliased.
.SH COMMANDS
.TP 4
\fBinstall\fR
Install the given compiler. The commands fails if the package is already installed (e.g. it will not transparently switch to the installed compiler switch, as \fBopam switch <name>\fR does).
.TP 4
\fBremove\fR
Remove the given compiler.
.TP 4
\fBexport\fR
Export the list installed package to a file.
.TP 4
\fBimport\fR
Install the packages from a file.
.TP 4
\fBreinstall\fR
Reinstall the given compiler switch. This will also try reinstall the installed packages.
.TP 4
\fBlist\fR
List the available compilers. The first column displays the switch name (if any), the second one the switch state (C = current, I = installed, \-\- = not installed), the third one the compiler name and the last one the compiler description. To switch to an already installed compiler alias (with state = I), use \fBopam switch <name>\fR. If you want to use a new compiler <comp>, use \fBopam switch <comp>\fR: this will download, compile and create a fresh and independant environment where new packages can be installed. If you want to create a new compiler alias (for instance because you already have this compiler version installed), use \fBopam switch <name> \-\-alias\-of <comp>\fR. In case <name> and <comp> are the same, this is equivalent to \fBopam switch <comp>\fR.
.TP 4
\fBshow\fR
Show the current compiler.
.SH COMMON OPTIONS
.P
These options are common to all commands.
.TP 4
\fB\-\-debug\fR
Print debug message on stdout. This is equivalent to setting \fB$OPAMDEBUG\fR to a value greater or equal to 2.
.TP 4
\fB\-\-help\fR[=\fIFMT\fR] (default=pager)
Show this help in format \fIFMT\fR (pager, plain or groff).
.TP 4
\fB\-\-no\-base\-packages\fR
Do not install base packages (useful for testing purposes). This is equivalent to setting \fB$OPAMNOBASEPACKAGES\fR to a non\-empty string.
.TP 4
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Be quiet when installing a new compiler.
.TP 4
\fB\-r\fR \fIROOT\fR, \fB\-\-root\fR=\fIROOT\fR (absent=/Users/tgazagna/.opam)
Use \fIROOT\fR as the current root path. This is equivalent to setting \fB$OPAMROOT\fR to \fIROOT\fR.
.TP 4
\fB\-s\fR \fISWITCH\fR, \fB\-\-switch\fR=\fISWITCH\fR
Use \fISWITCH\fR as the current compiler switch. This is equivalent to setting \fB$OPAMSWITCH\fR to \fISWITCH\fR.
.TP 4
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be more verbose. This is equivalent to setting either \fB$OPAMDEBUG\fR to a value greater or equal to 1 or \fB$OPAMVERBOSE\fR to a non\-empty string.
.TP 4
\fB\-\-version\fR
Show version information.
.TP 4
\fB\-y\fR, \fB\-\-yes\fR
Disable interactive mode and answer yes to all questions that would otherwise be asked to the user. This is equivalent to setting \fB$OPAMYES\fR to a non\-empty string.
