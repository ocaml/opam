(** Update the given repositories from their upstream, and returns the updated

    Packages that are members of the [working_dir] and are bound to a local
    directory under version control are synchronised with its working state,
    bypassing version control.

    If [autolock] is set to true, automatically update package from lock file
    if it was pinned with a lock file at first.

    Side-effect: update the reinstall file, adding installed changed packages to
    the current switch to-reinstall set.

    The returned boolean is true if all updates were successful. *)

(** Updates a single dev or pinned package from its upstream. If [working_dir]
    is set, and the package is bound to a local, version-controlled dir, use the
    working dir state instead of what has been committed to version control.

    If [autolock] is set to true, automatically update package from lock file
    if it was pinned with a lock file at first.

    Returns true if changed, false otherwise, and a switch_state update
    function, applying possible changes in packages metadata *)
