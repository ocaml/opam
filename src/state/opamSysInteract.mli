(** [available_packages ?env config pkgs] queries the system to determine
    which of the given system [pkgs] are available (i.e., present in the
    systemâ€™s package database  or known to the system's package manager).

    The result is an {!OpamSysPkg.availability_mode} type, which may either be
    a set of available packages or a flag indicating that availability should
    be assumed (e.g., on systems where querying is unsupported or skipped),
    or a flag that indicates that depexts are disabled.

(** Returns the subset of the given system [pkgs] that are currently installed
    on the system. This function queries the system package manager (e.g., apt,
    yum, pacman, brew, etc.) to determine which of the provided packages are
    already installed. It handles different package manager formats and output
    parsing, including virtual packages. *)

  (* [analyse_install path] searches for and identifies Cygwin/MSYS2
     installations. [path] may be able the location of cygcheck.exe itself
     (with or without the .exe) or just a directory. If [path] is just a
     directory, then the function searches for 'path\cygcheck.exe',
     'path\bin\cygcheck.exe', or 'path\usr\bin\cygcheck.exe'. If exactly one
     is found, and cygpath.exe is found with it, then cygpath is used both to
     identify whether the installation is Cygwin or MSYS2 and to translate the
     root directory [/] to its Windows path (i.e. to get the canonical root
     directory of the installation). MSYS2 is additionally required to have
     pacman.exe in the same directory as cygcheck.exe and cygpath.exe.

     On success, the result is the kind of installation (Cygwin/MSYS2) along
     with the root directory (e.g. {v C:\cygwin64 v} or {v C:\msys64 v}),
     otherwise a description of the problem encountered is returned. *)
