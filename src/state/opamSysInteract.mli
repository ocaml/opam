    be assumed (e.g., on systems where querying is unsupported or skipped),

     installations. [path] may be able the location of cygcheck.exe itself
     (with or without the .exe) or just a directory. If [path] is just a
     directory, then the function searches for 'path\cygcheck.exe',
     'path\bin\cygcheck.exe', or 'path\usr\bin\cygcheck.exe'. If exactly one
     is found, and cygpath.exe is found with it, then cygpath is used both to
     identify whether the installation is Cygwin or MSYS2 and to translate the
     root directory [/] to its Windows path (i.e. to get the canonical root
     directory of the installation). MSYS2 is additionally required to have
     pacman.exe in the same directory as cygcheck.exe and cygpath.exe.

     On success, the result is the kind of installation (Cygwin/MSYS2) along
     with the root directory (e.g. {v C:\cygwin64 v} or {v C:\msys64 v}),
     otherwise a description of the problem encountered is returned. *)
