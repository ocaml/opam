open OpamTypes

(** Client state *)

(** Phantom types to indicate the locking state of a state, and allow or not
    on-disk operations.

    Note that each state load is itself locking enough to return a consistent
    state: a read lock is only needed when the consistency of the actions depend
    on the fact that the given state doesn't change during the run (e.g. an
    update that depends on it). In particular, all query commands don't need a
    read lock.

    Subtyping is by guarantees given on the operations allowed, [rw] giving the
    most and being the smallest type, so that it is safe to coerce
    [(rw t :> ro t)].
